=head1 NAME

ffserver - ffserver video server

=head1 SYNOPSIS


ffserver [I<options>]


=head1 DESCRIPTION


B<ffserver> is a streaming server for both audio and video.
It supports several live feeds, streaming from files and time shifting
on live feeds. You can seek to positions in the past on each live
feed, provided you specify a big enough feed storage.

B<ffserver> is configured through a configuration file, which
is read at startup. If not explicitly specified, it will read from
F</etc/ffserver.conf>.

B<ffserver> receives prerecorded files or FFM streams from some
B<ffmpeg> instance as input, then streams them over
RTP/RTSP/HTTP.

An B<ffserver> instance will listen on some port as specified
in the configuration file. You can launch one or more instances of
B<ffmpeg> and send one or more FFM streams to the port where
ffserver is expecting to receive them. Alternately, you can make
B<ffserver> launch such B<ffmpeg> instances at startup.

Input streams are called feeds, and each one is specified by a
C<E<lt>FeedE<gt>> section in the configuration file.

For each feed you can have different output streams in various
formats, each one specified by a C<E<lt>StreamE<gt>> section in the
configuration file.


=head1 DETAILED DESCRIPTION


B<ffserver> works by forwarding streams encoded by
B<ffmpeg>, or pre-recorded streams which are read from disk.

Precisely, B<ffserver> acts as an HTTP server, accepting POST
requests from B<ffmpeg> to acquire the stream to publish, and
serving RTSP clients or HTTP clients GET requests with the stream
media content.

A feed is an B<FFM> stream created by B<ffmpeg>, and sent to
a port where B<ffserver> is listening.

Each feed is identified by a unique name, corresponding to the name
of the resource published on B<ffserver>, and is configured by
a dedicated C<Feed> section in the configuration file.

The feed publish URL is given by:
	
	http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<http_port>/<feed_name>


where I<ffserver_ip_address> is the IP address of the machine where
B<ffserver> is installed, I<http_port> is the port number of
the HTTP server (configured through the B<HTTPPort> option), and
I<feed_name> is the name of the corresponding feed defined in the
configuration file.

Each feed is associated to a file which is stored on disk. This stored
file is used to send pre-recorded data to a player as fast as
possible when new content is added in real-time to the stream.

A "live-stream" or "stream" is a resource published by
B<ffserver>, and made accessible through the HTTP protocol to
clients.

A stream can be connected to a feed, or to a file. In the first case,
the published stream is forwarded from the corresponding feed
generated by a running instance of B<ffmpeg>, in the second
case the stream is read from a pre-recorded file.

Each stream is identified by a unique name, corresponding to the name
of the resource served by B<ffserver>, and is configured by
a dedicated C<Stream> section in the configuration file.

The stream access HTTP URL is given by:
	
	http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<http_port>/<stream_name>[<options>]


The stream access RTSP URL is given by:
	
	http://<ffserver_ip_address>:<rtsp_port>/<stream_name>[<options>]


I<stream_name> is the name of the corresponding stream defined in
the configuration file. I<options> is a list of options specified
after the URL which affects how the stream is served by
B<ffserver>. I<http_port> and I<rtsp_port> are the HTTP
and RTSP ports configured with the options I<HTTPPort> and
I<RTSPPort> respectively.

In case the stream is associated to a feed, the encoding parameters
must be configured in the stream configuration. They are sent to
B<ffmpeg> when setting up the encoding. This allows
B<ffserver> to define the encoding parameters used by
the B<ffmpeg> encoders.

The B<ffmpeg> B<override_ffserver> commandline option
allows one to override the encoding parameters set by the server.

Multiple streams can be connected to the same feed.

For example, you can have a situation described by the following
graph:

	
	               _________       __________
	              |         |     |          |
	ffmpeg 1 -----| feed 1  |-----| stream 1 |
	    \         |_________|\    |__________|
	     \                    \
	      \                    \   __________
	       \                    \ |          |
	        \                    \| stream 2 |
	         \                    |__________|
	          \
	           \   _________       __________
	            \ |         |     |          |
	             \| feed 2  |-----| stream 3 |
	              |_________|     |__________|
	
	               _________       __________
	              |         |     |          |
	ffmpeg 2 -----| feed 3  |-----| stream 4 |
	              |_________|     |__________|
	
	               _________       __________
	              |         |     |          |

	              |_________|     |__________|
	




=head2 FFM, FFM2 formats


FFM and FFM2 are formats used by ffserver. They allow storing a wide variety of
video and audio streams and encoding options, and can store a moving time segment
of an infinite movie or a whole movie.

FFM is version specific, and there is limited compatibility of FFM files
generated by one version of ffmpeg/ffserver and another version of
ffmpeg/ffserver. It may work but it is not guaranteed to work.

FFM2 is extensible while maintaining compatibility and should work between
differing versions of tools. FFM2 is the default.


=head2 Status stream


B<ffserver> supports an HTTP interface which exposes the
current status of the server.

Simply point your browser to the address of the special status stream
specified in the configuration file.

For example if you have:
	
	<Stream status.html>
	Format status
	
	# Only allow local people to get the status
	ACL allow localhost
	ACL allow 192.168.0.0 192.168.255.255
	</Stream>


then the server will post a page with the status information when
the special stream F<status.html> is requested.


=head2 How do I make it work?


As a simple test, just run the following two command lines where INPUTFILE
is some file which you can decode with ffmpeg:

	
	ffserver -f doc/ffserver.conf &
	ffmpeg -i INPUTFILE http://localhost:8090/feed1.ffm


At this point you should be able to go to your Windows machine and fire up
Windows Media Player (WMP). Go to Open URL and enter

	
	    http://<linuxbox>:8090/test.asf


You should (after a short delay) see video and hear audio.

WARNING: trying to stream test1.mpg doesn't work with WMP as it tries to
transfer the entire file before starting to play.
The same is true of AVI files.

You should edit the F<ffserver.conf> file to suit your needs (in
terms of frame rates etc). Then install B<ffserver> and
B<ffmpeg>, write a script to start them up, and off you go.


=head2 What else can it do?


You can replay video from .ffm files that was recorded earlier.
However, there are a number of caveats, including the fact that the
ffserver parameters must match the original parameters used to record the
file. If they do not, then ffserver deletes the file before recording into it.
(Now that I write this, it seems broken).

You can fiddle with many of the codec choices and encoding parameters, and
there are a bunch more parameters that you cannot control. Post a message
to the mailing list if there are some 'must have' parameters. Look in
ffserver.conf for a list of the currently available controls.

It will automatically generate the ASX or RAM files that are often used
in browsers. These files are actually redirections to the underlying ASF
or RM file. The reason for this is that the browser often fetches the
entire file before starting up the external viewer. The redirection files
are very small and can be transferred quickly. [The stream itself is
often 'infinite' and thus the browser tries to download it and never
finishes.]


=head2 Tips


* When you connect to a live stream, most players (WMP, RA, etc) want to
buffer a certain number of seconds of material so that they can display the
signal continuously. However, ffserver (by default) starts sending data
in realtime. This means that there is a pause of a few seconds while the
buffering is being done by the player. The good news is that this can be
cured by adding a '?buffer=5' to the end of the URL. This means that the
stream should start 5 seconds in the past -- and so the first 5 seconds
of the stream are sent as fast as the network will allow. It will then
slow down to real time. This noticeably improves the startup experience.

You can also add a 'Preroll 15' statement into the ffserver.conf that will
add the 15 second prebuffering on all requests that do not otherwise
specify a time. In addition, ffserver will skip frames until a key_frame
is found. This further reduces the startup delay by not transferring data
that will be discarded.


=head2 Why does the ?buffer / Preroll stop working after a time?


It turns out that (on my machine at least) the number of frames successfully
grabbed is marginally less than the number that ought to be grabbed. This
means that the timestamp in the encoded data stream gets behind realtime.
This means that if you say 'Preroll 10', then when the stream gets 10
or more seconds behind, there is no Preroll left.

Fixing this requires a change in the internals of how timestamps are
handled.


=head2 Does the C<?date=> stuff work.


Yes (subject to the limitation outlined above). Also note that whenever you
start ffserver, it deletes the ffm file (if any parameters have changed),
thus wiping out what you had recorded before.

The format of the C<?date=xxxxxx> is fairly flexible. You should use one
of the following formats (the 'T' is literal):

	
	* YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS     (localtime)
	* YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ    (UTC)


You can omit the YYYY-MM-DD, and then it refers to the current day. However
note that B<?date=16:00:00> refers to 16:00 on the current day -- this
may be in the future and so is unlikely to be useful.

You use this by adding the ?date= to the end of the URL for the stream.
For example:   B<http://localhost:8080/test.asf?date=2002-07-26T23:05:00>.


=head1 OPTIONS


All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string
representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI
unit prefixes, for example: 'K', 'M', or 'G'.

If 'i' is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be
interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on
powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending 'B' to the SI unit
prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example:
'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as number suffixes.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo"
will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.



=head2 Stream specifiers

Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. C<-codec:a:1 ac3> contains the
C<a:1> stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in C<-b:a 128k> matches all audio
streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, C<-codec copy>
or C<-codec: copy> would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index. E.g. C<-threads:1 4> would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.

=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of following: 'v' or 'V' for video, 'a' for audio, 's'
for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. 'v' matches all video
streams, 'V' only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video
thumbnails or cover arts.  If I<stream_index> is given, then it matches
stream number I<stream_index> of this type. Otherwise, it matches all
streams of this type.

=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

If I<stream_index> is given, then it matches the stream with number I<stream_index>
in the program with the id I<program_id>. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the
program.

=item B<#>I<stream_id> B<or i:>I<stream_id>

Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).

=item B<m:>I<key>B<[:>I<value>B<]>

Matches streams with the metadata tag I<key> having the specified value. If
I<value> is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any
value.

=item B<u>

Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the
essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present.

Note that in B<ffmpeg>, matching by metadata will only work properly for
input files.

omitted. "repeat" can also be used alone.
If "repeat" is used alone, and with no prior loglevel set, the default
loglevel will be used. If multiple loglevel parameters are given, using
'repeat' will not change the loglevel.
I<loglevel> is a string or a number containing one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<quiet, -8>

Show nothing at all; be silent.

=item B<panic, 0>

Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as
an assertion failure. This is not currently used for anything.

=item B<fatal, 8>

Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely
cannot continue.

=item B<error, 16>

Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.

=item B<warning, 24>

Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly
incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.

=item B<verbose, 40>

Same as C<info>, except more verbose.

=item B<debug, 48>

Show everything, including debugging information.

=item B<trace, 56>


=back


By default the program logs to stderr. If coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
B<AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR> or B<NO_COLOR>, or can be forced setting
the environment variable B<AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR>.
The use of the environment variable B<NO_COLOR> is deprecated and
will be dropped in a future FFmpeg version.


=item B<-report>

Dump full command line and console output to a file named
C<I<program>-I<YYYYMMDD>-I<HHMMSS>.log> in the current
directory.
This file can be useful for bug reports.
It also implies C<-loglevel verbose>.

Setting the environment variable B<FFREPORT> to any value has the
same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence, these
options will affect the report; option values must be escaped if they
contain special characters or the options delimiter ':' (see the
``Quoting and escaping'' section in the ffmpeg-utils manual).

The following options are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<file>

set the file name to use for the report; C<%p> is expanded to the name
of the program, C<%t> is expanded to a timestamp, C<%%> is expanded
to a plain C<%>

=item B<level>

set the log verbosity level using a numerical value (see C<-loglevel>).

=back


For example, to output a report to a file named F<ffreport.log>
using a log level of C<32> (alias for log level C<info>):

	
	FFREPORT=file=ffreport.log:level=32 ffmpeg -i input output


Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will not
appear in the report.


=item B<-hide_banner>

Suppress printing banner.

All FFmpeg tools will normally show a copyright notice, build options
and library versions. This option can be used to suppress printing
this information.


=item B<-cpuflags flags (>I<global>B<)>

Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended
for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.
	
	ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...

=item B<-opencl_bench>

This option is used to benchmark all available OpenCL devices and print the
results. This option is only available when FFmpeg has been compiled with
C<--enable-opencl>.

When FFmpeg is configured with C<--enable-opencl>, the options for the
global OpenCL context are set via B<-opencl_options>. See the
"OpenCL Options" section in the ffmpeg-utils manual for the complete list of
supported options. Amongst others, these options include the ability to select
a specific platform and device to run the OpenCL code on. By default, FFmpeg
will run on the first device of the first platform. While the options for the
global OpenCL context provide flexibility to the user in selecting the OpenCL
device of their choice, most users would probably want to select the fastest
OpenCL device for their system.

This option assists the selection of the most efficient configuration by
identifying the appropriate device for the user's system. The built-in
benchmark is run on all the OpenCL devices and the performance is measured for
each device. The devices in the results list are sorted based on their
performance with the fastest device listed first. The user can subsequently
invoke B<ffmpeg> using the device deemed most appropriate via
B<-opencl_options> to obtain the best performance for the OpenCL
accelerated code.

Typical usage to use the fastest OpenCL device involve the following steps.

Run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -opencl_bench

Note down the platform ID (I<pidx>) and device ID (I<didx>) of the first
i.e. fastest device in the list.
Select the platform and device using the command:
	
	ffmpeg -opencl_options platform_idx=<pidx>:device_idx=<didx> ...



=item B<-opencl_options options (>I<global>B<)>

Set OpenCL environment options. This option is only available when
FFmpeg has been compiled with C<--enable-opencl>.

I<options> must be a list of I<key>=I<value> option pairs
separated by ':'. See the ``OpenCL Options'' section in the
ffmpeg-utils manual for the list of supported options.

=back



=head2 AVOptions


These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
B<-help> option. They are separated into two categories:

=over 4


=item B<generic>

These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.

=item B<private>

These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.

=back


For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the B<id3v2_version> private option of the MP3
muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3


All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier
should be attached to them.

Note: the B<-nooption> syntax cannot be used for boolean
AVOptions, use B<-option 0>/B<-option 1>.

Note: the old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
removed soon.


=head2 Main options



=over 4


=item B<-f> I<configfile>

Read configuration file F<configfile>. If not specified it will
read by default from F</etc/ffserver.conf>.


=item B<-n>

Enable no-launch mode. This option disables all the C<Launch>
directives within the various C<E<lt>FeedE<gt>> sections. Since
B<ffserver> will not launch any B<ffmpeg> instances, you
will have to launch them manually.


=item B<-d>

Enable debug mode. This option increases log verbosity, and directs
log messages to stdout. When specified, the B<CustomLog> option
is ignored.

=back



=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE SYNTAX


B<ffserver> reads a configuration file containing global
options and settings for each stream and feed.

The configuration file consists of global options and dedicated
sections, which must be introduced by "E<lt>I<SECTION_NAME>
I<ARGS>E<gt>" on a separate line and must be terminated by a line in
the form "E<lt>/I<SECTION_NAME>E<gt>". I<ARGS> is optional.

Currently the following sections are recognized: B<Feed>,
B<Stream>, B<Redirect>.

A line starting with C<#> is ignored and treated as a comment.

Name of options and sections are case-insensitive.


=head2 ACL syntax

An ACL (Access Control List) specifies the address which are allowed
to access a given stream, or to write a given feed.

It accepts the following forms

=over 4


=item *

Allow/deny access to I<address>.
	
	ACL ALLOW <address>
	ACL DENY <address>



=item *

Allow/deny access to ranges of addresses from I<first_address> to
I<last_address>.
	
	ACL ALLOW <first_address> <last_address>
	ACL DENY <first_address> <last_address>


=back


You can repeat the ACL allow/deny as often as you like. It is on a per
stream basis. The first match defines the action. If there are no matches,
then the default is the inverse of the last ACL statement.

Thus 'ACL allow localhost' only allows access from localhost.
'ACL deny 1.0.0.0 1.255.255.255' would deny the whole of network 1 and
allow everybody else.


=head2 Global options


=over 4


=item B<HTTPPort> I<port_number>


=item B<Port> I<port_number>


=item B<RTSPPort> I<port_number>


I<HTTPPort> sets the HTTP server listening TCP port number,
I<RTSPPort> sets the RTSP server listening TCP port number.

I<Port> is the equivalent of I<HTTPPort> and is deprecated.

You must select a different port from your standard HTTP web server if
it is running on the same computer.

If not specified, no corresponding server will be created.


=item B<HTTPBindAddress> I<ip_address>


=item B<BindAddress> I<ip_address>


=item B<RTSPBindAddress> I<ip_address>

Set address on which the HTTP/RTSP server is bound. Only useful if you
have several network interfaces.

I<BindAddress> is the equivalent of I<HTTPBindAddress> and is
deprecated.


=item B<MaxHTTPConnections> I<n>

Set number of simultaneous HTTP connections that can be handled. It
has to be defined I<before> the B<MaxClients> parameter,
since it defines the B<MaxClients> maximum limit.

Default value is 2000.


=item B<MaxClients> I<n>

Set number of simultaneous requests that can be handled. Since
B<ffserver> is very fast, it is more likely that you will want
to leave this high and use B<MaxBandwidth>.

Default value is 5.


=item B<MaxBandwidth> I<kbps>

Set the maximum amount of kbit/sec that you are prepared to consume
when streaming to clients.

Default value is 1000.


=item B<CustomLog> I<filename>

Set access log file (uses standard Apache log file format). '-' is the
standard output.

If not specified B<ffserver> will produce no log.

In case the commandline option B<-d> is specified this option is
ignored, and the log is written to standard output.


=item B<NoDaemon>

Set no-daemon mode. This option is currently ignored since now
B<ffserver> will always work in no-daemon mode, and is
deprecated.


=item B<UseDefaults>


=item B<NoDefaults>

Control whether default codec options are used for the all streams or not.
Each stream may overwrite this setting for its own. Default is I<UseDefaults>.
The last occurrence overrides the previous if multiple definitions exist.

=back



=head2 Feed section


A Feed section defines a feed provided to B<ffserver>.

Each live feed contains one video and/or audio sequence coming from an
B<ffmpeg> encoder or another B<ffserver>. This sequence
may be encoded simultaneously with several codecs at several
resolutions.

A feed instance specification is introduced by a line in the form:
	
	<Feed FEED_FILENAME>


where I<FEED_FILENAME> specifies the unique name of the FFM stream.

The following options are recognized within a Feed section.


=over 4


=item B<File> I<filename>


=item B<ReadOnlyFile> I<filename>

Set the path where the feed file is stored on disk.

If not specified, the F</tmp/FEED.ffm> is assumed, where
I<FEED> is the feed name.

If B<ReadOnlyFile> is used the file is marked as read-only and
it will not be deleted or updated.


=item B<Truncate>

Truncate the feed file, rather than appending to it. By default
B<ffserver> will append data to the file, until the maximum
file size value is reached (see B<FileMaxSize> option).


=item B<FileMaxSize> I<size>

Set maximum size of the feed file in bytes. 0 means unlimited. The
postfixes C<K> (2^10), C<M> (2^20), and C<G> (2^30) are
recognized.

Default value is 5M.


=item B<Launch> I<args>

Launch an B<ffmpeg> command when creating B<ffserver>.

I<args> must be a sequence of arguments to be provided to an
B<ffmpeg> instance. The first provided argument is ignored, and
it is replaced by a path with the same dirname of the B<ffserver>
instance, followed by the remaining argument and terminated with a
path corresponding to the feed.

When the launched process exits, B<ffserver> will launch
another program instance.

In case you need a more complex B<ffmpeg> configuration,
e.g. if you need to generate multiple FFM feeds with a single
B<ffmpeg> instance, you should launch B<ffmpeg> by hand.

This option is ignored in case the commandline option B<-n> is
specified.


=item B<ACL> I<spec>

Specify the list of IP address which are allowed or denied to write
the feed. Multiple ACL options can be specified.

=back



=head2 Stream section


A Stream section defines a stream provided by B<ffserver>, and
identified by a single name.

The stream is sent when answering a request containing the stream
name.

A stream section must be introduced by the line:
	
	<Stream STREAM_NAME>


where I<STREAM_NAME> specifies the unique name of the stream.

The following options are recognized within a Stream section.

Encoding options are marked with the I<encoding> tag, and they are
used to set the encoding parameters, and are mapped to libavcodec
encoding options. Not all encoding options are supported, in
particular it is not possible to set encoder private options. In order
to override the encoding options specified by B<ffserver>, you
can use the B<ffmpeg> B<override_ffserver> commandline
option.

Only one of the B<Feed> and B<File> options should be set.


=over 4


=item B<Feed> I<feed_name>

Set the input feed. I<feed_name> must correspond to an existing
feed defined in a C<Feed> section.

When this option is set, encoding options are used to setup the
encoding operated by the remote B<ffmpeg> process.


=item B<File> I<filename>

Set the filename of the pre-recorded input file to stream.

When this option is set, encoding options are ignored and the input
file content is re-streamed as is.


=item B<Format> I<format_name>

Set the format of the output stream.

Must be the name of a format recognized by FFmpeg. If set to
B<status>, it is treated as a status stream.


=item B<InputFormat> I<format_name>

Set input format. If not specified, it is automatically guessed.


=item B<Preroll> I<n>

Set this to the number of seconds backwards in time to start. Note that
most players will buffer 5-10 seconds of video, and also you need to allow
for a keyframe to appear in the data stream.

Default value is 0.


=item B<StartSendOnKey>

Do not send stream until it gets the first key frame. By default
B<ffserver> will send data immediately.


=item B<MaxTime> I<n>

Set the number of seconds to run. This value set the maximum duration
of the stream a client will be able to receive.

A value of 0 means that no limit is set on the stream duration.

=head1 SYNTAX


This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
libraries and tools.



=head2 Quoting and escaping


FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:


=over 4


=item *

B<'> and B<\> are special characters (respectively used for
quoting and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other
special characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping
and quoting are employed.


=item *

A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a B<\>.


=item *

All characters enclosed between B<''> are included literally in the
parsed string. The quote character B<'> itself cannot be quoted,
so you may need to close the quote and escape it.


=item *

Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
removed from the parsed string.

=back


Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using
the command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the
adopted shell language.

The function C<av_get_token> defined in
F<libavutil/avstring.h> can be used to parse a token quoted or
escaped according to the rules defined above.

The tool F<tools/ffescape> in the FFmpeg source tree can be used
to automatically quote or escape a string in a script.


=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Escape the string C<Crime d'Amour> containing the C<'> special
character:
	
	Crime d\'Amour



=item *

The string above contains a quote, so the C<'> needs to be escaped
when quoting it:
	
	'Crime d'\''Amour'



=item *

Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:
	
	'  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '



=item *

Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:
	
	' The string '\'string\'' is a string '



=item *

To include a literal B<\> you can use either escaping or quoting:
	
	'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo


=back




=head2 Date


The accepted syntax is:
	
	[(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
	now


If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as UTC.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.



=head2 Time duration


There are two accepted syntaxes for expressing time duration.

	
	[-][<HH>:]<MM>:<SS>[.<m>...]


I<HH> expresses the number of hours, I<MM> the number of minutes
for a maximum of 2 digits, and I<SS> the number of seconds for a
maximum of 2 digits. The I<m> at the end expresses decimal value for
I<SS>.

I<or>

	
	[-]<S>+[.<m>...]


I<S> expresses the number of seconds, with the optional decimal part
I<m>.

In both expressions, the optional B<-> indicates negative duration.


=head3 Examples


The following examples are all valid time duration:


=over 4


=item B<55>

55 seconds


=item B<12:03:45>

12 hours, 03 minutes and 45 seconds


=item B<23.189>

23.189 seconds

=head2 Video rate


Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
I<frame_rate_num>/I<frame_rate_den>, an integer number, a float
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation.

=head2 Ratio


A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
I<numerator>:I<denominator>.

Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
considered valid, so you should check on the returned value if you
want to exclude those values.

The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.



=head2 Color


It can be the name of a color as defined below (case insensitive match) or a
C<[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA]> sequence, possibly followed by @ and a string
representing the alpha component.

The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the opacity value (B<0x00> or B<0.0> means completely
transparent, B<0xff> or B<1.0> completely opaque). If the alpha
component is not specified then B<0xff> is assumed.

The string B<random> will result in a random color.

=head2 Channel Layout


A channel layout specifies the spatial disposition of the channels in
a multi-channel audio stream. To specify a channel layout, FFmpeg
makes use of a special syntax.

Individual channels are identified by an id, as given by the table
below:

A custom channel layout can be specified as a sequence of terms, separated by
'+' or '|'. Each term can be:

=over 4


=item *

the name of a standard channel layout (e.g. B<mono>,
B<stereo>, B<4.0>, B<quad>, B<5.0>, etc.)


=item *

the name of a single channel (e.g. B<FL>, B<FR>, B<FC>, B<LFE>, etc.)


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'c', yielding the default channel
layout for that number of channels (see the function
C<av_get_default_channel_layout>). Note that not all channel counts have a
default layout.


=item *

a number of channels, in decimal, followed by 'C', yielding an unknown channel
layout with the specified number of channels. Note that not all channel layout
specification strings support unknown channel layouts.


=item *

a channel layout mask, in hexadecimal starting with "0x" (see the
C<AV_CH_*> macros in F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.

=back


Before libavutil version 53 the trailing character "c" to specify a number of
channels was optional, but now it is required, while a channel layout mask can
also be specified as a decimal number (if and only if not followed by "c" or "C").

See also the function C<av_get_channel_layout> defined in
F<libavutil/channel_layout.h>.


=head1 EXPRESSION EVALUATION


When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
formula evaluator, implemented through the F<libavutil/eval.h>
interface.

An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
functions.

Two expressions I<expr1> and I<expr2> can be combined to form
another expression "I<expr1>;I<expr2>".
I<expr1> and I<expr2> are evaluated in turn, and the new
expression evaluates to the value of I<expr2>.

The following binary operators are available: C<+>, C<->,
C<*>, C</>, C<^>.

The following unary operators are available: C<+>, C<->.

The following functions are available:

=over 4


=item B<abs(x)>

Compute absolute value of I<x>.


=item B<acos(x)>

Compute arccosine of I<x>.


=item B<asin(x)>

Compute arcsine of I<x>.

equal to I<max>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<bitand(x, y)>


=item B<bitor(x, y)>

Compute bitwise and/or operation on I<x> and I<y>.

The results of the evaluation of I<x> and I<y> are converted to
integers before executing the bitwise operation.

Note that both the conversion to integer and the conversion back to
floating point can lose precision. Beware of unexpected results for
large numbers (usually 2^53 and larger).


=item B<ceil(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> upwards to the nearest
integer. For example, "ceil(1.5)" is "2.0".


=item B<clip(x, min, max)>

I<y> are 0 or either or both are less than zero then behavior is undefined.


=item B<gt(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is greater than I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<gte(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is greater than or equal to I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<hypot(x, y)>

This function is similar to the C function with the same name; it returns
"sqrt(I<x>*I<x> + I<y>*I<y>)", the length of the hypotenuse of a
right triangle with sides of length I<x> and I<y>, or the distance of the
point (I<x>, I<y>) from the origin.


=item B<if(x, y)>

Evaluate I<x>, and if the result is non-zero return the result of
the evaluation of I<y>, return 0 otherwise.

I<var>, which was previously stored with st(I<var>, I<expr>).
The function returns the loaded value.


=item B<lerp(x, y, z)>

Return linear interpolation between I<x> and I<y> by amount of I<z>.


=item B<log(x)>

Compute natural logarithm of I<x>.


=item B<lt(x, y)>

Return 1 if I<x> is lesser than I<y>, 0 otherwise.


=item B<lte(x, y)>

I<l> is not specified then a default log level is used.
Returns the value of the expression printed.

Prints t with loglevel l


=item B<random(x)>

Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. I<x> is the index of the
internal variable which will be used to save the seed/state.


=item B<root(expr, max)>

Find an input value for which the function represented by I<expr>
with argument I<ld(0)> is 0 in the interval 0..I<max>.

The expression in I<expr> must denote a continuous function or the
result is undefined.

I<ld(0)> is used to represent the function input value, which means
that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times with
various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(0)>. When the expression evaluates to 0 then the
corresponding input value will be returned.


=item B<round(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> to the nearest integer. For example, "round(1.5)" is "2.0".


=item B<sin(x)>

Compute sine of I<x>.


=item B<sinh(x)>

Compute hyperbolic sine of I<x>.


=item B<sqrt(expr)>

Compute the square root of I<expr>. This is equivalent to

=item B<squish(x)>

Compute expression C<1/(1 + exp(4*x))>.


=item B<st(var, expr)>

Store the value of the expression I<expr> in an internal
variable. I<var> specifies the number of the variable where to
store the value, and it is a value ranging from 0 to 9. The function
returns the value stored in the internal variable.
Note, Variables are currently not shared between expressions.


=item B<tan(x)>

Compute tangent of I<x>.


=item B<tanh(x)>

Compute hyperbolic tangent of I<x>.


=item B<taylor(expr, x)>


=item B<taylor(expr, x, id)>

Evaluate a Taylor series at I<x>, given an expression representing
the C<ld(id)>-th derivative of a function at 0.

When the series does not converge the result is undefined.

I<ld(id)> is used to represent the derivative order in I<expr>,
which means that the given expression will be evaluated multiple times
with various input values that the expression can access through
C<ld(id)>. If I<id> is not specified then 0 is assumed.

Note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0,
C<taylor(expr, x-y)> can be used.


=item B<time(0)>

Return the current (wallclock) time in seconds.


=item B<trunc(expr)>

Round the value of expression I<expr> towards zero to the nearest
integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".


=item B<while(cond, expr)>

Evaluate expression I<expr> while the expression I<cond> is
non-zero, and returns the value of the last I<expr> evaluation, or
NAN if I<cond> was always false.

=back


The following constants are available:

=over 4


=item B<PI>

area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

=item B<E>

exp(1) (Euler's number), approximately 2.718

=item B<PHI>

golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2, approximately 1.618

=back


Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
value, note that:

C<*> works like AND

C<+> works like OR

For example the construct:
	
	if (A AND B) then C

is equivalent to:
	
	if(A*B, C)


In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
expressions.

The evaluator also recognizes the International System unit prefixes.
If 'i' is appended after the prefix, binary prefixes are used, which
are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000.
The 'B' postfix multiplies the value by 8, and can be appended after a
unit prefix or used alone. This allows using for example 'KB', 'MiB',
'G' and 'B' as number postfix.

The list of available International System prefixes follows, with
indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

=head1 OPENCL OPTIONS


When FFmpeg is configured with C<--enable-opencl>, it is possible
to set the options for the global OpenCL context.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<build_options>

Set build options used to compile the registered kernels.

See reference "OpenCL Specification Version: 1.2 chapter 5.6.4".


=item B<platform_idx>

Select the index of the platform to run OpenCL code.

The specified index must be one of the indexes in the device list
which can be obtained with C<ffmpeg -opencl_bench> or C<av_opencl_get_device_list()>.


=item B<device_idx>

Select the index of the device used to run OpenCL code.

The specified index must be one of the indexes in the device list which
can be obtained with C<ffmpeg -opencl_bench> or C<av_opencl_get_device_list()>.


=back




=head1 CODEC OPTIONS


libavcodec provides some generic global options, which can be set on
all the encoders and decoders. In addition each codec may support
so-called private options, which are specific for a given codec.

Sometimes, a global option may only affect a specific kind of codec,
and may be nonsensical or ignored by another, so you need to be aware
of the meaning of the specified options. Also some options are
meant only for decoding or encoding.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVCodecContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follow:


=over 4


=item B<b> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,audio,video>B<)>

Set bitrate in bits/s. Default value is 200K.

=item B<bt> I<integer> B<(>I<encoding,video>B<)>

Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from the
target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on quality.

=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<palette>

Specify the global palette used by the bitmaps. When stored in VobSub, the
palette is normally specified in the index file; in Matroska, the palette is
stored in the codec extra-data in the same format as in VobSub. In DVDs, the
palette is stored in the IFO file, and therefore not available when reading
from dumped VOB files.

The format for this option is a string containing 16 24-bits hexadecimal
numbers (without 0x prefix) separated by comas, for example C<0d00ee,

List of teletext page numbers to decode. You may use the special * string to
match all pages. Pages that do not match the specified list are dropped.
Default value is *.

=item B<txt_chop_top>

Discards the top teletext line. Default value is 1.

=item B<txt_format>

Specifies the format of the decoded subtitles. The teletext decoder is capable
of decoding the teletext pages to bitmaps or to simple text, you should use
"bitmap" for teletext pages, because certain graphics and colors cannot be
expressed in simple text. You might use "text" for teletext based subtitles if
your application can handle simple text based subtitles. Default value is
bitmap.

=item B<txt_left>

X offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

=item B<txt_top>

Y offset of generated bitmaps, default is 0.

=item B<txt_chop_spaces>

Chops leading and trailing spaces and removes empty lines from the generated
text. This option is useful for teletext based subtitles where empty spaces may
be present at the start or at the end of the lines or empty lines may be
present between the subtitle lines because of double-sized teletext characters.

enabled encoders.



=head1 AUDIO ENCODERS


A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
follows.



=head2 aac


Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) encoder.

This encoder is the default AAC encoder, natively implemented into FFmpeg. Its
quality is on par or better than libfdk_aac at the default bitrate of 128kbps.
This encoder also implements more options, profiles and samplerates than
other encoders (with only the AAC-HE profile pending to be implemented) so this
encoder has become the default and is the recommended choice.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<b>

Set bit rate in bits/s. Setting this automatically activates constant bit rate
(CBR) mode. If this option is unspecified it is set to 128kbps.


=item B<q>

Set quality for variable bit rate (VBR) mode. This option is valid only using
the B<ffmpeg> command-line tool. For library interface users, use
B<global_quality>.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency. If unspecified will allow the encoder to dynamically
adjust the cutoff to improve clarity on low bitrates.


=item B<aac_coder>

Set AAC encoder coding method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<twoloop>

Two loop searching (TLS) method.

This method first sets quantizers depending on band thresholds and then tries
to find an optimal combination by adding or subtracting a specific value from
all quantizers and adjusting some individual quantizer a little.  Will tune
itself based on whether B<aac_is>, B<aac_ms> and B<aac_pns>
are enabled.
This is the default choice for a coder.


=item B<anmr>

Average noise to mask ratio (ANMR) trellis-based solution.

This is an experimental coder which currently produces a lower quality, is more
unstable and is slower than the default twoloop coder but has potential.
Currently has no support for the B<aac_is> or B<aac_pns> options.
Not currently recommended.


=item B<fast>

Constant quantizer method.

This method sets a constant quantizer for all bands. This is the fastest of all
the methods and has no rate control or support for B<aac_is> or
B<aac_pns>.
Not recommended.


=back



=item B<aac_ms>

Sets mid/side coding mode. The default value of "auto" will automatically use
M/S with bands which will benefit from such coding. Can be forced for all bands
using the value "enable", which is mainly useful for debugging or disabled using
"disable".


=item B<aac_is>

Sets intensity stereo coding tool usage. By default, it's enabled and will
automatically toggle IS for similar pairs of stereo bands if it's beneficial.
Can be disabled for debugging by setting the value to "disable".


=item B<aac_pns>

Uses perceptual noise substitution to replace low entropy high frequency bands
with imperceptible white noise during the decoding process. By default, it's
enabled, but can be disabled for debugging purposes by using "disable".


=item B<aac_tns>

Enables the use of a multitap FIR filter which spans through the high frequency
bands to hide quantization noise during the encoding process and is reverted
by the decoder. As well as decreasing unpleasant artifacts in the high range
this also reduces the entropy in the high bands and allows for more bits to
be used by the mid-low bands. By default it's enabled but can be disabled for
debugging by setting the option to "disable".


=item B<aac_ltp>

Enables the use of the long term prediction extension which increases coding
efficiency in very low bandwidth situations such as encoding of voice or
solo piano music by extending constant harmonic peaks in bands throughout
frames. This option is implied by profile:a aac_low and is incompatible with
aac_pred. Use in conjunction with B<-ar> to decrease the samplerate.


=item B<aac_pred>

Enables the use of a more traditional style of prediction where the spectral
coefficients transmitted are replaced by the difference of the current
coefficients minus the previous "predicted" coefficients. In theory and sometimes
in practice this can improve quality for low to mid bitrate audio.
This option implies the aac_main profile and is incompatible with aac_ltp.


=item B<profile>

Sets the encoding profile, possible values:


=over 4


=item B<aac_low>

The default, AAC "Low-complexity" profile. Is the most compatible and produces
decent quality.


=item B<mpeg2_aac_low>

Equivalent to C<-profile:a aac_low -aac_pns 0>. PNS was introduced with the
MPEG4 specifications.


=item B<aac_ltp>

Long term prediction profile, is enabled by and will enable the B<aac_ltp>
option. Introduced in MPEG4.


=item B<aac_main>

Main-type prediction profile, is enabled by and will enable the B<aac_pred>
option. Introduced in MPEG2.


=back

If this option is unspecified it is set to B<aac_low>.

=head2 ac3 and ac3_fixed


AC-3 audio encoders.

These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as well as
the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

The I<ac3> encoder uses floating-point math, while the I<ac3_fixed>
encoder only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce better
quality audio for a given bitrate. The I<ac3_fixed> encoder is not the
default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be specified explicitly
using the option C<-acodec ac3_fixed> in order to use it.


=head3 AC-3 Metadata


The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the audio,
but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some of the options
do directly affect or influence the decoding and playback of the resulting
bitstream, while others are just for informational purposes. A few of the
options will add bits to the output stream that could otherwise be used for
audio data, and will thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be
indicated accordingly with a note in the option list below.

These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
documents.

=item B<-mixing_level> I<number>

Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the production
environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are 80 to 111, or -1 for
unknown or not indicated. The default value is -1, but that value cannot be

if the C<room_type> option is not the default value, the C<mixing_level>
option must not be -1.


=item B<-room_type> I<type>

level shift during audio reproduction that sets the average volume of the
dialogue to a preset level. The goal is to match volume level between program
sources. A value of -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to
the source volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers in
the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.


=item B<-dsur_mode> I<mode>

Dolby Surround Mode. Specifies whether the stereo signal uses Dolby Surround

=item B<-stereo_rematrixing> I<boolean>

Stereo Rematrixing. Enables/Disables use of rematrixing for stereo input. This

the left/right channels as mid/side. This option is enabled by default, and it
is highly recommended that it be left as enabled except for testing purposes.

=over 4



=item B<-channel_coupling> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3 feature
that increases quality by combining high frequency information from multiple
channels into a single channel. The per-channel high frequency information is
sent with less accuracy in both the frequency and time domains. This allows
more bits to be used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information
to reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default for the
floating-point encoder and should generally be left as enabled except for
testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

=head2 libfdk_aac


libfdk-aac AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) encoder wrapper.

The libfdk-aac library is based on the Fraunhofer FDK AAC code from
the Android project.

Requires the presence of the libfdk-aac headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libfdk-aac>. The library is also incompatible with GPL,
so if you allow the use of GPL, you should configure with
C<--enable-gpl --enable-nonfree --enable-libfdk-aac>.

This encoder is considered to produce output on par or worse at 128kbps to the
B<the native FFmpeg AAC encoder> but can often produce better
sounding audio at identical or lower bitrates and has support for the
AAC-HE profiles.

VBR encoding, enabled through the B<vbr> or B<flags
+qscale> options, is experimental and only works with some
combinations of parameters.

Support for encoding 7.1 audio is only available with libfdk-aac 0.1.3 or
higher.

For more information see the fdk-aac project at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/p/opencore-amr/fdk-aac/>E<gt>.


=head3 Options

following: 4000, 6000, 8000, 12000, or 20000, corresponding to
narrowband, mediumband, wideband, super wideband, and fullband
respectively. The default is 0 (cutoff disabled).


=item B<mapping_family (>I<mapping_family>B<)>

Set channel mapping family to be used by the encoder. The default value of -1
uses mapping family 0 for mono and stereo inputs, and mapping family 1
otherwise. The default also disables the surround masking and LFE bandwidth
optimzations in libopus, and requires that the input contains 8 channels or
fewer.

Other values include 0 for mono and stereo, 1 for surround sound with masking
and LFE bandwidth optimizations, and 255 for independent streams with an
unspecified channel layout.

=head2 libshine


Shine Fixed-Point MP3 encoder wrapper.

Shine is a fixed-point MP3 encoder. It has a far better performance on
platforms without an FPU, e.g. armel CPUs, and some phones and tablets.
However, as it is more targeted on performance than quality, it is not on par
with LAME and other production-grade encoders quality-wise. Also, according to
the project's homepage, this encoder may not be free of bugs as the code was
written a long time ago and the project was dead for at least 5 years.

This encoder only supports stereo and mono input. This is also CBR-only.

The original project (last updated in early 2007) is at
E<lt>B<http://sourceforge.net/projects/libshine-fxp/>E<gt>. We only support the
updated fork by the Savonet/Liquidsoap project at E<lt>B<https://github.com/savonet/shine>E<gt>.

=head2 libwebp


libwebp WebP Image encoder wrapper

libwebp is Google's official encoder for WebP images. It can encode in either
lossy or lossless mode. Lossy images are essentially a wrapper around a VP8
frame. Lossless images are a separate codec developed by Google.


=head3 Pixel Format


Currently, libwebp only supports YUV420 for lossy and RGB for lossless due
to limitations of the format and libwebp. Alpha is supported for either mode.
Because of API limitations, if RGB is passed in when encoding lossy or YUV is
passed in for encoding lossless, the pixel format will automatically be
converted using functions from libwebp. This is not ideal and is done only for
convenience.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<-lossless> I<boolean>

Enables/Disables use of lossless mode. Default is 0.


=item B<-compression_level> I<integer>

For lossy, this is a quality/speed tradeoff. Higher values give better quality
for a given size at the cost of increased encoding time. For lossless, this is
a size/speed tradeoff. Higher values give smaller size at the cost of increased
encoding time. More specifically, it controls the number of extra algorithms
and compression tools used, and varies the combination of these tools. This
maps to the I<method> option in libwebp. The valid range is 0 to 6.
Default is 4.


=item B<-qscale> I<float>

For lossy encoding, this controls image quality, 0 to 100. For lossless
encoding, this controls the effort and time spent at compressing more. The
default value is 75. Note that for usage via libavcodec, this option is called
I<global_quality> and must be multiplied by I<FF_QP2LAMBDA>.


=item B<-preset> I<type>

Configuration preset. This does some automatic settings based on the general
type of the image.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Do not use a preset.

=item B<default>

Use the encoder default.

=item B<picture>

=head2 libx264, libx264rgb


x264 H.264/MPEG-4 AVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libx264>.

libx264 supports an impressive number of features, including 8x8 and
4x4 adaptive spatial transform, adaptive B-frame placement, CAVLC/CABAC
entropy coding, interlacing (MBAFF), lossless mode, psy optimizations
for detail retention (adaptive quantization, psy-RD, psy-trellis).

Many libx264 encoder options are mapped to FFmpeg global codec
options, while unique encoder options are provided through private
options. Additionally the B<x264opts> and B<x264-params>
private options allows one to pass a list of key=value tuples as accepted
by the libx264 C<x264_param_parse> function.

The x264 project website is at
E<lt>B<http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html>E<gt>.

The libx264rgb encoder is the same as libx264, except it accepts packed RGB
pixel formats as input instead of YUV.


=head3 Supported Pixel Formats


x264 supports 8- to 10-bit color spaces. The exact bit depth is controlled at
x264's configure time. FFmpeg only supports one bit depth in one particular
build. In other words, it is not possible to build one FFmpeg with multiple
versions of x264 with different bit depths.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libx264 wrapper. The
B<x264>-equivalent options or values are listed in parentheses
for easy migration.

To reduce the duplication of documentation, only the private options
and some others requiring special attention are documented here. For
the documentation of the undocumented generic options, see

=item B<x264opts (N.A.)>

Set any x264 option, see B<x264 --fullhelp> for a list.

Argument is a list of I<key>=I<value> couples separated by
":". In I<filter> and I<psy-rd> options that use ":" as a separator
themselves, use "," instead. They accept it as well since long ago but this
is kept undocumented for some reason.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i foo.mpg -c:v libx264 -x264opts keyint=123:min-keyint=20 -an out.mkv



=item B<a53cc> I<boolean>

Import closed captions (which must be ATSC compatible format) into output.
Only the mpeg2 and h264 decoders provide these. Default is 1 (on).


=item B<x264-params (N.A.)>

Override the x264 configuration using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters.

This option is functionally the same as the B<x264opts>, but is
duplicated for compatibility with the Libav fork.

For example to specify libx264 encoding options with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v libx264 -x264-params level=30:bframes=0:weightp=0:\
	cabac=0:ref=1:vbv-maxrate=768:vbv-bufsize=2000:analyse=all:me=umh:\

Encoding ffpresets for common usages are provided so they can be used with the
general presets system (e.g. passing the B<pre> option).


=head2 libx265


x265 H.265/HEVC encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libx265 headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
B<--enable-libx265>.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<preset>

Set the x265 preset.


=item B<tune>

Set the x265 tune parameter.


=item B<forced-idr>

Normally, when forcing a I-frame type, the encoder can select any type
of I-frame. This option forces it to choose an IDR-frame.


=item B<x265-params>

Set x265 options using a list of I<key>=I<value> couples separated
by ":". See B<x265 --help> for a list of options.

For example to specify libx265 encoding options with B<-x265-params>:

	
	ffmpeg -i input -c:v libx265 -x265-params crf=26:psy-rd=1 output.mp4


=back



=head2 libxvid


Xvid MPEG-4 Part 2 encoder wrapper.

This encoder requires the presence of the libxvidcore headers and library
during configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
C<--enable-libxvid --enable-gpl>.

The native C<mpeg4> encoder supports the MPEG-4 Part 2 format, so
users can encode to this format without this library.


=head3 Options


The following options are supported by the libxvid wrapper. Some of
the following options are listed but are not documented, and
correspond to shared codec options. See B<the Codec
Options chapter> for their documentation. The other shared options
which are not listed have no effect for the libxvid encoder.

Set structural similarity (SSIM) displaying method. Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<off>

Disable displaying of SSIM information.


=item B<avg>

Output average SSIM at the end of encoding to stdout. The format of
showing the average SSIM is:

	
	Average SSIM: %f

=item B<bits_per_mb> I<integer>

How many bits to allot for coding one macroblock. Different profiles use
between 200 and 2400 bits per macroblock, the maximum is 8000.


=item B<mbs_per_slice> I<integer>

Number of macroblocks in each slice (1-8); the default value (8)
should be good in almost all situations.


=item B<vendor> I<string>

Override the 4-byte vendor ID.
A custom vendor ID like I<apl0> would claim the stream was produced by
the Apple encoder.


=item B<alpha_bits> I<integer>

Specify number of bits for alpha component.
Possible values are I<0>, I<8> and I<16>.
Use I<0> to disable alpha plane coding.


=back



=head3 Speed considerations


In the default mode of operation the encoder has to honor frame constraints
(i.e. not produce frames with size bigger than requested) while still making
output picture as good as possible.
A frame containing a lot of small details is harder to compress and the encoder
would spend more time searching for appropriate quantizers for each slice.

Setting a higher B<bits_per_mb> limit will improve the speed.

For the fastest encoding speed set the B<qscale> parameter (4 is the
recommended value) and do not set a size constraint.


=head2 QSV encoders


The family of Intel QuickSync Video encoders (MPEG-2, H.264 and HEVC)

The ratecontrol method is selected as follows:


=over 4


=item *

When B<global_quality> is specified, a quality-based mode is used.
Specifically this means either

=over 4


=item -

I<CQP> - constant quantizer scale, when the B<qscale> codec flag is
also set (the B<-qscale> ffmpeg option).


=item -

I<LA_ICQ> - intelligent constant quality with lookahead, when the
B<look_ahead> option is also set.


=item -

I<ICQ> -- intelligent constant quality otherwise.

=back



=item *

Otherwise, a bitrate-based mode is used. For all of those, you should specify at
least the desired average bitrate with the B<b> option.

=over 4


=item -

I<LA> - VBR with lookahead, when the B<look_ahead> option is specified.


=item -

I<VCM> - video conferencing mode, when the B<vcm> option is set.


=item -

I<CBR> - constant bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified and equal to
the average bitrate.


=item -

I<VBR> - variable bitrate, when B<maxrate> is specified, but is higher
than the average bitrate.


=item -

I<AVBR> - average VBR mode, when B<maxrate> is not specified. This mode
is further configured by the B<avbr_accuracy> and
B<avbr_convergence> options.

=back


=back


Note that depending on your system, a different mode than the one you specified
may be selected by the encoder. Set the verbosity level to I<verbose> or
higher to see the actual settings used by the QSV runtime.

Additional libavcodec global options are mapped to MSDK options as follows:


=over 4


=item *

B<g/gop_size> -E<gt> B<GopPicSize>


=item *

B<bf/max_b_frames>+1 -E<gt> B<GopRefDist>

=item *

B<b_strategy/b_frame_strategy> -E<gt> B<BRefType>


=item *

B<cgop/CLOSED_GOP> codec flag -E<gt> B<GopOptFlag>


=item *

For the I<CQP> mode, the B<i_qfactor/i_qoffset> and
B<b_qfactor/b_qoffset> set the difference between I<QPP> and I<QPI>,
and I<QPP> and I<QPB> respectively.


=item *

Setting the B<coder> option to the value I<vlc> will make the H.264
encoder use CAVLC instead of CABAC.

=head2 VAAPI encoders


Wrappers for hardware encoders accessible via VAAPI.

These encoders only accept input in VAAPI hardware surfaces.  If you have input
in software frames, use the B<hwupload> filter to upload them to the GPU.

The following standard libavcodec options are used:

=over 4


=item *

B<g> / B<gop_size>

=item *

B<bf> / B<max_b_frames>

=item B<h264_vaapi>

B<profile> sets the value of I<profile_idc> and the I<constraint_set*_flag>s.
B<level> sets the value of I<level_idc>.


=over 4


=item B<low_power>

Use low-power encoding mode.

=item B<coder>

Set entropy encoder (default is I<cabac>).  Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<ac>


=item B<cabac>

Use CABAC.


=item B<vlc>


=item B<cavlc>

Use CAVLC.

=back


=back



=item B<hevc_vaapi>

B<profile> and B<level> set the values of
I<general_profile_idc> and I<general_level_idc> respectively.


=item B<mjpeg_vaapi>

Always encodes using the standard quantisation and huffman tables -
B<global_quality> scales the standard quantisation table (range 1-100).


=item B<mpeg2_vaapi>

B<profile> and B<level> set the value of I<profile_and_level_indication>.

No rate control is supported.


=item B<vp8_vaapi>

B-frames are not supported.

B<global_quality> sets the I<q_idx> used for non-key frames (range 0-127).


=over 4


=item B<loop_filter_level>


=item B<loop_filter_sharpness>

Manually set the loop filter parameters.

=back



=item B<vp9_vaapi>

B<global_quality> sets the I<q_idx> used for P-frames (range 0-255).


=over 4


=item B<loop_filter_level>


=item B<loop_filter_sharpness>

Manually set the loop filter parameters.

=back


B-frames are supported, but the output stream is always in encode order rather than display
order.  If B-frames are enabled, it may be necessary to use the B<vp9_raw_reorder>
bitstream filter to modify the output stream to display frames in the correct order.

Only normal frames are produced - the B<vp9_superframe> bitstream filter may be
required to produce a stream usable with all decoders.


=back



=head2 vc2


SMPTE VC-2 (previously BBC Dirac Pro). This codec was primarily aimed at
professional broadcasting but since it supports yuv420, yuv422 and yuv444 at
8 (limited range or full range), 10 or 12 bits, this makes it suitable for
other tasks which require low overhead and low compression (like screen
recording).


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<b>

Sets target video bitrate. Usually that's around 1:6 of the uncompressed
video bitrate (e.g. for 1920x1080 50fps yuv422p10 that's around 400Mbps). Higher
values (close to the uncompressed bitrate) turn on lossless compression mode.


=item B<field_order>

Enables field coding when set (e.g. to tt - top field first) for interlaced
inputs. Should increase compression with interlaced content as it splits the
fields and encodes each separately.


=item B<wavelet_depth>

Sets the total amount of wavelet transforms to apply, between 1 and 5 (default).
Lower values reduce compression and quality. Less capable decoders may not be
able to handle values of B<wavelet_depth> over 3.


=item B<wavelet_type>

Sets the transform type. Currently only I<5_3> (LeGall) and I<9_7>
(Deslauriers-Dubuc)
are implemented, with 9_7 being the one with better compression and thus
is the default.


=item B<slice_width>


=item B<slice_height>

Sets the slice size for each slice. Larger values result in better compression.
For compatibility with other more limited decoders use B<slice_width> of
32 and B<slice_height> of 8.


=item B<tolerance>

Sets the undershoot tolerance of the rate control system in percent. This is
to prevent an expensive search from being run.


=item B<qm>

Sets the quantization matrix preset to use by default or when B<wavelet_depth>
is set to 5

=over 4


=item -

I<default>
Uses the default quantization matrix from the specifications, extended with
values for the fifth level. This provides a good balance between keeping detail
and omitting artifacts.


=item -

I<flat>
Use a completely zeroed out quantization matrix. This increases PSNR but might
reduce perception. Use in bogus benchmarks.


=item -

I<color>
Reduces detail but attempts to preserve color at extremely low bitrates.

=back

=head1 SUBTITLES ENCODERS



=head2 dvdsub


This codec encodes the bitmap subtitle format that is used in DVDs.
Typically they are stored in VOBSUB file pairs (*.idx + *.sub),
and they can also be used in Matroska files.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<even_rows_fix>

When set to 1, enable a work-around that makes the number of pixel rows
even in all subtitles.  This fixes a problem with some players that
cut off the bottom row if the number is odd.  The work-around just adds
a fully transparent row if needed.  The overhead is low, typically
one byte per subtitle on average.

By default, this work-around is disabled.

=back



=head1 BITSTREAM FILTERS


When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported bitstream
filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
the configure option C<--list-bsfs>.

You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
C<--disable-bsfs>, and selectively enable any bitstream filter using
the option C<--enable-bsf=BSF>, or you can disable a particular
bitstream filter using the option C<--disable-bsf=BSF>.

The option C<-bsfs> of the ff* tools will display the list of
all the supported bitstream filters included in your build.

The ff* tools have a -bsf option applied per stream, taking a
comma-separated list of filters, whose parameters follow the filter
name after a '='.

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v copy -bsf:v filter1[=opt1=str1:opt2=str2][,filter2] OUTPUT


Below is a description of the currently available bitstream filters,
with their parameters, if any.


=head2 aac_adtstoasc


Convert MPEG-2/4 AAC ADTS to an MPEG-4 Audio Specific Configuration
bitstream.

This filter creates an MPEG-4 AudioSpecificConfig from an MPEG-2/4
ADTS header and removes the ADTS header.

This filter is required for example when copying an AAC stream from a
raw ADTS AAC or an MPEG-TS container to MP4A-LATM, to an FLV file, or
to MOV/MP4 files and related formats such as 3GP or M4A. Please note
that it is auto-inserted for MP4A-LATM and MOV/MP4 and related formats.


=head2 chomp


Remove zero padding at the end of a packet.


=head2 dca_core


Extract the core from a DCA/DTS stream, dropping extensions such as
DTS-HD.


=head2 dump_extra


Add extradata to the beginning of the filtered packets.

The additional argument specifies which packets should be filtered.
It accepts the values:

=over 4


=item B<a>

add extradata to all key packets, but only if I<local_header> is
set in the B<flags2> codec context field


=item B<k>

add extradata to all key packets


=item B<e>

add extradata to all packets

=back


If not specified it is assumed B<k>.

For example the following B<ffmpeg> command forces a global
header (thus disabling individual packet headers) in the H.264 packets
generated by the C<libx264> encoder, but corrects them by adding
the header stored in extradata to the key packets:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -flags:v +global_header -c:v libx264 -bsf:v dump_extra out.ts



=head2 extract_extradata


Extract the in-band extradata.

Certain codecs allow the long-term headers (e.g. MPEG-2 sequence headers,
or H.264/HEVC (VPS/)SPS/PPS) to be transmitted either "in-band" (i.e. as a part
of the bitstream containing the coded frames) or "out of band" (e.g. on the
container level). This latter form is called "extradata" in FFmpeg terminology.

This bitstream filter detects the in-band headers and makes them available as
extradata.


=over 4


=item B<remove>

When this option is enabled, the long-term headers are removed from the
bitstream after extraction.

=back



=head2 h264_mp4toannexb


Convert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format (muxer C<mpegts>).

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an H.264 stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts


Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
C<mpegts>) and raw H.264 (muxer C<h264>) output formats.


=head2 hevc_mp4toannexb


Convert an HEVC/H.265 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.265
specification).

This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
transport stream format (muxer C<mpegts>).

For example to remux an MP4 file containing an HEVC stream to mpegts
format with B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v hevc_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts


Please note that this filter is auto-inserted for MPEG-TS (muxer
C<mpegts>) and raw HEVC/H.265 (muxer C<h265> or
C<hevc>) output formats.


=head2 imxdump


Modifies the bitstream to fit in MOV and to be usable by the Final Cut
Pro decoder. This filter only applies to the mpeg2video codec, and is
likely not needed for Final Cut Pro 7 and newer with the appropriate
B<-tag:v>.

For example, to remux 30 MB/sec NTSC IMX to MOV:

	
	ffmpeg -i input.mxf -c copy -bsf:v imxdump -tag:v mx3n output.mov



=head2 mjpeg2jpeg


Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a
JPEG image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss,
e.g. by

	
	ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg


Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because
they lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
E<lt>B<http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml>E<gt>:

Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the
MJPG fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* --
Huffman table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2,
and it must use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or
progressive. . . . You can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and
decode them with a regular JPEG decoder, but you have to prepend
the DHT segment to them, or else the decoder won't have any idea
how to decompress the data. The exact table necessary is given in
the OpenDML spec."

This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an MJPEG
stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
produce fully qualified JPEG images.

	
	ffmpeg -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
	exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
	ffmpeg -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi



=head2 mjpegadump


Add an MJPEG A header to the bitstream, to enable decoding by
Quicktime.



=head2 mov2textsub


Extract a representable text file from MOV subtitles, stripping the
metadata header from each subtitle packet.

See also the B<text2movsub> filter.


=head2 mp3decomp


Decompress non-standard compressed MP3 audio headers.


=head2 mpeg4_unpack_bframes


Unpack DivX-style packed B-frames.

DivX-style packed B-frames are not valid MPEG-4 and were only a
workaround for the broken Video for Windows subsystem.
They use more space, can cause minor AV sync issues, require more
CPU power to decode (unless the player has some decoded picture queue
to compensate the 2,0,2,0 frame per packet style) and cause
trouble if copied into a standard container like mp4 or mpeg-ps/ts,
because MPEG-4 decoders may not be able to decode them, since they are
not valid MPEG-4.

For example to fix an AVI file containing an MPEG-4 stream with
DivX-style packed B-frames using B<ffmpeg>, you can use the command:

	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT.avi -codec copy -bsf:v mpeg4_unpack_bframes OUTPUT.avi



=head2 noise


Damages the contents of packets or simply drops them without damaging the
container. Can be used for fuzzing or testing error resilience/concealment.

Parameters:

=over 4


=item B<amount>

A numeral string, whose value is related to how often output bytes will
be modified. Therefore, values below or equal to 0 are forbidden, and
the lower the more frequent bytes will be modified, with 1 meaning
every byte is modified.

=item B<dropamount>

A numeral string, whose value is related to how often packets will be dropped.
Therefore, values below or equal to 0 are forbidden, and the lower the more
frequent packets will be dropped, with 1 meaning every packet is dropped.

=back


The following example applies the modification to every byte but does not drop
any packets.
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c copy -bsf noise[=1] output.mkv



=head2 null

This bitstream filter passes the packets through unchanged.


=head2 remove_extra

=head2 text2movsub


Convert text subtitles to MOV subtitles (as used by the C<mov_text>
codec) with metadata headers.

See also the B<mov2textsub> filter.


=head2 vp9_superframe


Merge VP9 invisible (alt-ref) frames back into VP9 superframes. This
fixes merging of split/segmented VP9 streams where the alt-ref frame
was split from its visible counterpart.

Split VP9 superframes into single frames.


=head2 vp9_raw_reorder


Given a VP9 stream with correct timestamps but possibly out of order,
insert additional show-existing-frame packets to correct the ordering.


=head1 FORMAT OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the muxers and demuxers. In addition each muxer or
demuxer may support so-called private options, which are specific for
that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<avioflags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<direct>

Reduce buffering.

=back



=item B<probesize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set probing size in bytes, i.e. the size of the data to analyze to get
stream information. A higher value will enable detecting more
information in case it is dispersed into the stream, but will increase
latency. Must be an integer not lesser than 32. It is 5000000 by default.


=item B<packetsize> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set packet size.


=item B<fflags> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Set format flags.

Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<ignidx>

Ignore index.

=item B<fastseek>

Enable fast, but inaccurate seeks for some formats.

=item B<genpts>

Generate PTS.

=item B<nofillin>

Do not fill in missing values that can be exactly calculated.

=item B<noparse>

Disable AVParsers, this needs C<+nofillin> too.

=item B<igndts>

Ignore DTS.

=item B<discardcorrupt>

Discard corrupted frames.

=item B<sortdts>

Try to interleave output packets by DTS.

=item B<keepside>

Do not merge side data.

=item B<latm>

Enable RTP MP4A-LATM payload.

=item B<nobuffer>

Reduce the latency introduced by optional buffering

=item B<bitexact>

Only write platform-, build- and time-independent data.
This ensures that file and data checksums are reproducible and match between
platforms. Its primary use is for regression testing.

=item B<shortest>

Stop muxing at the end of the shortest stream.
It may be needed to increase max_interleave_delta to avoid flushing the longer
streams before EOF.

=back



=item B<seek2any> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Allow seeking to non-keyframes on demuxer level when supported if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<analyzeduration> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specify how many microseconds are analyzed to probe the input. A
higher value will enable detecting more accurate information, but will
increase latency. It defaults to 5,000,000 microseconds = 5 seconds.


=item B<cryptokey> I<hexadecimal string> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set decryption key.


=item B<indexmem> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set max memory used for timestamp index (per stream).


=item B<rtbufsize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set max memory used for buffering real-time frames.


=item B<fdebug> I<flags> B<(>I<input/output>B<)>

Set maximum muxing or demuxing delay in microseconds.


=item B<fpsprobesize> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set number of frames used to probe fps.


=item B<audio_preload> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set microseconds by which audio packets should be interleaved earlier.


=item B<chunk_duration> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set microseconds for each chunk.


=item B<chunk_size> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set size in bytes for each chunk.


=item B<err_detect, f_err_detect> I<flags> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set error detection flags. C<f_err_detect> is deprecated and
should be used only via the B<ffmpeg> tool.

Possible values:

wild as errors.

=item B<compliant>

Consider all spec non compliancies as errors.

=item B<aggressive>

Consider things that a sane encoder should not do as an error.

=back



=item B<max_interleave_delta> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set maximum buffering duration for interleaving. The duration is
expressed in microseconds, and defaults to 1000000 (1 second).

To ensure all the streams are interleaved correctly, libavformat will
wait until it has at least one packet for each stream before actually
writing any packets to the output file. When some streams are
"sparse" (i.e. there are large gaps between successive packets), this
can result in excessive buffering.

This field specifies the maximum difference between the timestamps of the
first and the last packet in the muxing queue, above which libavformat
will output a packet regardless of whether it has queued a packet for all
the streams.

If set to 0, libavformat will continue buffering packets until it has
a packet for each stream, regardless of the maximum timestamp
difference between the buffered packets.


=item B<use_wallclock_as_timestamps> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Use wallclock as timestamps if set to 1. Default is 0.


=item B<avoid_negative_ts> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>


Possible values:

=over 4


=item B<make_non_negative>

Shift timestamps to make them non-negative.
Also note that this affects only leading negative timestamps, and not
non-monotonic negative timestamps.

=item B<make_zero>

Shift timestamps so that the first timestamp is 0.

=item B<auto (default)>

Enables shifting when required by the target format.

=item B<disabled>

Disables shifting of timestamp.

=back


When shifting is enabled, all output timestamps are shifted by the
same amount. Audio, video, and subtitles desynching and relative
timestamp differences are preserved compared to how they would have
been without shifting.


=item B<skip_initial_bytes> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set number of bytes to skip before reading header and frames if set to 1.
Default is 0.


=item B<correct_ts_overflow> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Correct single timestamp overflows if set to 1. Default is 1.


=item B<flush_packets> I<integer> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Flush the underlying I/O stream after each packet. Default is -1 (auto), which
means that the underlying protocol will decide, 1 enables it, and has the
effect of reducing the latency, 0 disables it and may increase IO throughput in
some cases.


=item B<output_ts_offset> I<offset> B<(>I<output>B<)>

Set the output time offset.

I<offset> must be a time duration specification,
see B<the Time duration section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>.

The offset is added by the muxer to the output timestamps.

Specifying a positive offset means that the corresponding streams are
delayed bt the time duration specified in I<offset>. Default value
is C<0> (meaning that no offset is applied).


=item B<format_whitelist> I<list> B<(>I<input>B<)>

"," separated list of allowed demuxers. By default all are allowed.


=item B<dump_separator> I<string> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Separator used to separate the fields printed on the command line about the
Stream parameters.
For example to separate the fields with newlines and indention:
	
	ffprobe -dump_separator "
	                          "  -i ~/videos/matrixbench_mpeg2.mpg



=item B<max_streams> I<integer> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Specifies the maximum number of streams. This can be used to reject files that
would require too many resources due to a large number of streams.

=back





=head2 Format stream specifiers


Format stream specifiers allow selection of one or more streams that
match specific properties.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index.


=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of following: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio,
's' for subtitle, 'd' for data, and 't' for attachments. If
I<stream_index> is given, then it matches the stream number
I<stream_index> of this type. Otherwise, it matches all streams of
this type.


=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

If I<stream_index> is given, then it matches the stream with number
I<stream_index> in the program with the id
I<program_id>. Otherwise, it matches all streams in the program.


=item B<#>I<stream_id>

Matches the stream by a format-specific ID.

=back


The exact semantics of stream specifiers is defined by the
C<avformat_match_stream_specifier()> function declared in the
F<libavformat/avformat.h> header.


=head1 DEMUXERS


Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg that can read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option C<--list-demuxers>.

You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
C<--disable-demuxers>, and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option C<--enable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>, or disable it
with the option C<--disable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>>.

The option C<-demuxers> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers. Use C<-formats> to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.

The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.


=head2 aa


Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux Audible Format 2, 3, and 4 (.aa) files.


=head2 applehttp


Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is
available in a metadata key named "variant_bitrate".


=head2 apng


Animated Portable Network Graphics demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux APNG files.
All headers, but the PNG signature, up to (but not including) the first
fcTL chunk are transmitted as extradata.
Frames are then split as being all the chunks between two fcTL ones, or
between the last fcTL and IEND chunks.


=over 4


=item B<-ignore_loop> I<bool>

Ignore the loop variable in the file if set.

=item B<-max_fps> I<int>

Maximum framerate in frames per second (0 for no limit).

=item B<-default_fps> I<int>

Default framerate in frames per second when none is specified in the file
(0 meaning as fast as possible).

=back



=head2 asf


Advanced Systems Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux ASF files and MMS network streams.


=over 4


=item B<-no_resync_search> I<bool>

Do not try to resynchronize by looking for a certain optional start code.

=back




=head2 concat


Virtual concatenation script demuxer.

This demuxer reads a list of files and other directives from a text file and
demuxes them one after the other, as if all their packets had been muxed
together.

The timestamps in the files are adjusted so that the first file starts at 0
and each next file starts where the previous one finishes. Note that it is
done globally and may cause gaps if all streams do not have exactly the same
length.

All files must have the same streams (same codecs, same time base, etc.).

The duration of each file is used to adjust the timestamps of the next file:
if the duration is incorrect (because it was computed using the bit-rate or
because the file is truncated, for example), it can cause artifacts. The
C<duration> directive can be used to override the duration stored in
each file.


=head3 Syntax


The script is a text file in extended-ASCII, with one directive per line.
Empty lines, leading spaces and lines starting with '#' are ignored. The
following directive is recognized:


=over 4



=item B<C<file I<path>>>

Path to a file to read; special characters and spaces must be escaped with
backslash or single quotes.

All subsequent file-related directives apply to that file.


=item B<C<ffconcat version 1.0>>

Identify the script type and version. It also sets the B<safe> option
to 1 if it was -1.

To make FFmpeg recognize the format automatically, this directive must
appear exactly as is (no extra space or byte-order-mark) on the very first
line of the script.


=item B<C<duration I<dur>>>

Duration of the file. This information can be specified from the file;
specifying it here may be more efficient or help if the information from the
file is not available or accurate.

If the duration is set for all files, then it is possible to seek in the
whole concatenated video.


=item B<C<inpoint I<timestamp>>>

In point of the file. When the demuxer opens the file it instantly seeks to the
specified timestamp. Seeking is done so that all streams can be presented
successfully at In point.

This directive works best with intra frame codecs, because for non-intra frame
ones you will usually get extra packets before the actual In point and the
decoded content will most likely contain frames before In point too.

For each file, packets before the file In point will have timestamps less than
the calculated start timestamp of the file (negative in case of the first
file), and the duration of the files (if not specified by the C<duration>
directive) will be reduced based on their specified In point.

Because of potential packets before the specified In point, packet timestamps
may overlap between two concatenated files.


=item B<C<outpoint I<timestamp>>>

Out point of the file. When the demuxer reaches the specified decoding
timestamp in any of the streams, it handles it as an end of file condition and
skips the current and all the remaining packets from all streams.

Out point is exclusive, which means that the demuxer will not output packets
with a decoding timestamp greater or equal to Out point.

This directive works best with intra frame codecs and formats where all streams
are tightly interleaved. For non-intra frame codecs you will usually get
additional packets with presentation timestamp after Out point therefore the
decoded content will most likely contain frames after Out point too. If your
streams are not tightly interleaved you may not get all the packets from all
streams before Out point and you may only will be able to decode the earliest
stream until Out point.

The duration of the files (if not specified by the C<duration>
directive) will be reduced based on their specified Out point.


=item B<C<file_packet_metadata I<key=value>>>

Metadata of the packets of the file. The specified metadata will be set for
each file packet. You can specify this directive multiple times to add multiple
metadata entries.


=item B<C<stream>>

Introduce a stream in the virtual file.
All subsequent stream-related directives apply to the last introduced
stream.
Some streams properties must be set in order to allow identifying the
matching streams in the subfiles.
If no streams are defined in the script, the streams from the first file are
copied.


=item B<C<exact_stream_id I<id>>>

Set the id of the stream.
If this directive is given, the string with the corresponding id in the
subfiles will be used.
This is especially useful for MPEG-PS (VOB) files, where the order of the
streams is not reliable.


=back



=head3 Options


This demuxer accepts the following option:


=over 4



=item B<safe>

If set to 1, reject unsafe file paths. A file path is considered safe if it
does not contain a protocol specification and is relative and all components
only contain characters from the portable character set (letters, digits,
period, underscore and hyphen) and have no period at the beginning of a
component.

If set to 0, any file name is accepted.

The default is 1.

-1 is equivalent to 1 if the format was automatically
probed and 0 otherwise.


=item B<auto_convert>

If set to 1, try to perform automatic conversions on packet data to make the
streams concatenable.
The default is 1.

Currently, the only conversion is adding the h264_mp4toannexb bitstream
filter to H.264 streams in MP4 format. This is necessary in particular if
there are resolution changes.


=item B<segment_time_metadata>

If set to 1, every packet will contain the I<lavf.concat.start_time> and the
I<lavf.concat.duration> packet metadata values which are the start_time and
the duration of the respective file segments in the concatenated output
expressed in microseconds. The duration metadata is only set if it is known
based on the concat file.
The default is 0.


=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Use absolute filenames and include some comments:
	
	# my first filename
	file /mnt/share/file-1.wav
	# my second filename including whitespace
	file '/mnt/share/file 2.wav'
	# my third filename including whitespace plus single quote
	file '/mnt/share/file 3'\''.wav'



=item *

Allow for input format auto-probing, use safe filenames and set the duration of
the first file:
	
	ffconcat version 1.0
	
	file file-1.wav
	duration 20.0
	
	file subdir/file-2.wav


=back



=head2 flv, live_flv


Adobe Flash Video Format demuxer.

This demuxer is used to demux FLV files and RTMP network streams. In case of live network streams, if you force format, you may use live_flv option instead of flv to survive timestamp discontinuities.

	
	ffmpeg -f flv -i myfile.flv ...
	ffmpeg -f live_flv -i rtmp://<any.server>/anything/key ....




=over 4


=item B<-flv_metadata> I<bool>

Allocate the streams according to the onMetaData array content.

=back



=head2 gif


Animated GIF demuxer.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<min_delay>

Set the minimum valid delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 2.


=item B<max_gif_delay>

Set the maximum valid delay between frames in hundredth of seconds.
Range is 0 to 65535. Default value is 65535 (nearly eleven minutes),
the maximum value allowed by the specification.


=item B<default_delay>

Set the default delay between frames in hundredths of seconds.
Range is 0 to 6000. Default value is 10.


=item B<ignore_loop>

GIF files can contain information to loop a certain number of times (or
infinitely). If B<ignore_loop> is set to 1, then the loop setting
from the input will be ignored and looping will not occur. If set to 0,
then looping will occur and will cycle the number of times according to
the GIF. Default value is 1.

=back


For example, with the overlay filter, place an infinitely looping GIF
over another video:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ignore_loop 0 -i input.gif -filter_complex overlay=shortest=1 out.mkv


Note that in the above example the shortest option for overlay filter is
used to end the output video at the length of the shortest input file,
which in this case is F<input.mp4> as the GIF in this example loops
infinitely.


=head2 hls


HLS demuxer

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<live_start_index>

segment index to start live streams at (negative values are from the end).


=item B<allowed_extensions>

',' separated list of file extensions that hls is allowed to access.


=item B<max_reload>

Maximum number of times a insufficient list is attempted to be reloaded.
Default value is 1000.

=back



=head2 image2


Image file demuxer.

This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option I<pattern_type>.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.

The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<framerate>

Set the frame rate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

=item B<loop>

If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

=item B<pattern_type>

Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

I<pattern_type> accepts one of the following values.

=over 4


=item B<none>

Disable pattern matching, therefore the video will only contain the specified
image. You should use this option if you do not want to create sequences from
multiple images and your filenames may contain special pattern characters.

=item B<sequence>

Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.

A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
"%d0I<N>d" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0-padded and I<N> is the total number of 0-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string "%%".

If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between I<start_number> and
I<start_number>+I<start_number_range>-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form F<i%m%g-1.jpg>,
F<i%m%g-2.jpg>, ..., F<i%m%g-10.jpg>, etc.

Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to convert a single image file
F<img.jpeg> you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png



=item B<glob>

Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

The pattern is interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.


=item B<glob_sequence> I<(deprecated, will be removed)>

Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
C<%*?[]{}> that is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.

All glob special characters C<%*?[]{}> must be prefixed
with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".

For example the pattern C<foo-%*.jpeg> will match all the
filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
C<foo-%?%?%?.jpeg> will match all the filenames prefixed with
"foo-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with ".jpeg".

This pattern type is deprecated in favor of I<glob> and
I<sequence>.

=back


Default value is I<glob_sequence>.

=item B<pixel_format>

Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the pixel
format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<start_number>

Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to start
to read from. Default value is 0.

=item B<start_number_range>

Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first image
file in the sequence, starting from I<start_number>. Default value
is 5.

=item B<ts_from_file>

If set to 1, will set frame timestamp to modification time of image file. Note
that monotonity of timestamps is not provided: images go in the same order as
without this option. Default value is 0.
If set to 2, will set frame timestamp to the modification time of the image file in
nanosecond precision.

=item B<video_size>

Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the video
size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=back



=head3 Examples

=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> for creating a video from the images in the file
sequence F<img-001.jpeg>, F<img-002.jpeg>, ..., assuming an
input frame rate of 10 frames per second:
	
	ffmpeg -framerate 10 -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' out.mkv



=item *

As above, but start by reading from a file with index 100 in the sequence:
	
	ffmpeg -framerate 10 -start_number 100 -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' out.mkv

This demuxer allows reading of MJPEG, where each frame is represented as a part of
multipart/x-mixed-replace stream.

=over 4



=item B<strict_mime_boundary>

Default implementation applies a relaxed standard to multi-part MIME boundary detection,
to prevent regression with numerous existing endpoints not generating a proper MIME
MJPEG stream. Turning this option on by setting it to 1 will result in a stricter check
of the boundary value.

=back



=head2 rawvideo


Raw video demuxer.

This demuxer allows one to read raw video data. Since there is no header
specifying the assumed video parameters, the user must specify them
in order to be able to decode the data correctly.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4



=item B<framerate>

Set input video frame rate. Default value is 25.


=item B<pixel_format>

Set the input video pixel format. Default value is C<yuv420p>.


=item B<video_size>

Set the input video size. This value must be specified explicitly.

=back


For example to read a rawvideo file F<input.raw> with
B<ffplay>, assuming a pixel format of C<rgb24>, a video
size of C<320x240>, and a frame rate of 10 images per second, use
the command:
	
	ffplay -f rawvideo -pixel_format rgb24 -video_size 320x240 -framerate 10 input.raw



=head2 sbg


SBaGen script demuxer.

This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
E<lt>B<http://uazu.net/sbagen/>E<gt> to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
script looks like that:
	
	-SE
	a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
	b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
	off: -
	NOW      == a
	+0:07:00 == b
	+0:14:00 == a
	+0:21:00 == b
	+0:30:00    off


A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the I<NOW> reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.


=head2 tedcaptions


JSON captions used for E<lt>B<http://www.ted.com/>E<gt>.

TED does not provide links to the captions, but they can be guessed from the
page. The file F<tools/bookmarklets.html> from the FFmpeg source tree
contains a bookmarklet to expose them.

This demuxer accepts the following option:

=over 4


=item B<start_time>

Set the start time of the TED talk, in milliseconds. The default is 15000
(15s). It is used to sync the captions with the downloadable videos, because
they include a 15s intro.

=back


Example: convert the captions to a format most players understand:
	
	ffmpeg -i http://www.ted.com/talks/subtitles/id/1/lang/en talk1-en.srt



=head1 MUXERS


Muxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow writing
multimedia streams to a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported muxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available muxers using the
configure option C<--list-muxers>.

You can disable all the muxers with the configure option
C<--disable-muxers> and selectively enable / disable single muxers
with the options C<--enable-muxer=I<MUXER>> /
C<--disable-muxer=I<MUXER>>.

The option C<-muxers> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled muxers. Use C<-formats> to view a combined list of
enabled demuxers and muxers.

A description of some of the currently available muxers follows.



=head2 aiff


Audio Interchange File Format muxer.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<write_id3v2>

Enable ID3v2 tags writing when set to 1. Default is 0 (disabled).


=item B<id3v2_version>

Select ID3v2 version to write. Currently only version 3 and 4 (aka.
ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4) are supported. The default is version 4.


=back




=head2 asf


Advanced Systems Format muxer.

Note that Windows Media Audio (wma) and Windows Media Video (wmv) use this
muxer too.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<packet_size>

Set the muxer packet size. By tuning this setting you may reduce data
fragmentation or muxer overhead depending on your source. Default value is
3200, minimum is 100, maximum is 64k.


=back




=head2 avi


Audio Video Interleaved muxer.


=head3 Options


It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<reserve_index_space>

Reserve the specified amount of bytes for the OpenDML master index of each
stream within the file header. By default additional master indexes are
embedded within the data packets if there is no space left in the first master
index and are linked together as a chain of indexes. This index structure can
cause problems for some use cases, e.g. third-party software strictly relying
on the OpenDML index specification or when file seeking is slow. Reserving
enough index space in the file header avoids these problems.

The required index space depends on the output file size and should be about 16
bytes per gigabyte. When this option is omitted or set to zero the necessary
index space is guessed.


=item B<write_channel_mask>

Write the channel layout mask into the audio stream header.

This option is enabled by default. Disabling the channel mask can be useful in
specific scenarios, e.g. when merging multiple audio streams into one for
compatibility with software that only supports a single audio stream in AVI
(see B<the "amerge" section in the ffmpeg-filters manual>).


=back




=head2 chromaprint


Chromaprint fingerprinter

This muxer feeds audio data to the Chromaprint library, which generates
a fingerprint for the provided audio data. It takes a single signed
native-endian 16-bit raw audio stream.

=head2 crc


CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio
and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
CRC=0xI<CRC>, where I<CRC> is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to
8 digits containing the CRC for all the decoded input frames.

See also the B<framecrc> muxer.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the CRC of the input, and store it in the file
F<out.crc>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc out.crc


You can print the CRC to stdout with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc -


You can select the output format of each frame with B<ffmpeg> by
specifying the audio and video codec and format. For example to
compute the CRC of the input audio converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit
and the input video converted to MPEG-2 video, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f crc -



=head2 flv

DASH-templated name to be used for baseURL. Implies I<single_file> set to "1".

=item B<-init_seg_name> I<init_name>

DASH-templated name to used for the initialization segment. Default is "init-stream$RepresentationID$.m4s"

=item B<-media_seg_name> I<segment_name>

DASH-templated name to used for the media segments. Default is "chunk-stream$RepresentationID$-$Number%05d$.m4s"

=item B<-utc_timing_url> I<utc_url>

URL of the page that will return the UTC timestamp in ISO format. Example: "https://time.akamai.com/?iso"

=item B<-adaptation_sets> I<adaptation_sets>

Assign streams to AdaptationSets. Syntax is "id=x,streams=a,b,c id=y,streams=d,e" with x and y being the IDs
of the adaptation sets and a,b,c,d and e are the indices of the mapped streams.

To map all video (or audio) streams to an AdaptationSet, "v" (or "a") can be used as stream identifier instead of IDs.

When no assignment is defined, this defaults to an AdaptationSet for each stream.

=back




=head2 framecrc


Per-packet CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC for each audio
and video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed
16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
CRC.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
	
	<stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, 0x<CRC>


I<CRC> is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the
CRC of the packet.


=head3 Examples


For example to compute the CRC of the audio and video frames in
F<INPUT>, converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it
in the file F<out.crc>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc out.crc


To print the information to stdout, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc -


With B<ffmpeg>, you can select the output format to which the
audio and video frames are encoded before computing the CRC for each
packet by specifying the audio and video codec. For example, to
compute the CRC of each decoded input audio frame converted to PCM
unsigned 8-bit and of each decoded input video frame converted to
MPEG-2 video, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f framecrc -


See also the B<crc> muxer.



=head2 framehash


Per-packet hash testing format.

This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash for each audio
and video packet. This can be used for packet-by-packet equality
checks without having to individually do a binary comparison on each.

By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. It uses the
SHA-256 cryptographic hash function by default, but supports several
other algorithms.

The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
packet of the form:
	
	<stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, <hash>


I<hash> is a hexadecimal number representing the computed hash
for the packet.


=over 4


=item B<hash> I<algorithm>

Use the cryptographic hash function specified by the string I<algorithm>.
Supported values include C<MD5>, C<murmur3>, C<RIPEMD128>,
C<RIPEMD160>, C<RIPEMD256>, C<RIPEMD320>, C<SHA160>,
C<SHA224>, C<SHA256> (default), C<SHA512/224>, C<SHA512/256>,
C<SHA384>, C<SHA512>, C<CRC32> and C<adler32>.


=back



=head3 Examples


To compute the SHA-256 hash of the audio and video frames in F<INPUT>,
converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
F<out.sha256>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framehash out.sha256


To print the information to stdout, using the MD5 hash function, use
the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framehash -hash md5 -


See also the B<hash> muxer.



=head2 framemd5


Per-packet MD5 testing format.

This is a variant of the B<framehash> muxer. Unlike that muxer,
it defaults to using the MD5 hash function.


=head3 Examples


To compute the MD5 hash of the audio and video frames in F<INPUT>,
converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
F<out.md5>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 out.md5


To print the information to stdout, use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 -


See also the B<framehash> and B<md5> muxers.



=head2 gif


Animated GIF muxer.

It accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<loop>

Set the number of times to loop the output. Use C<-1> for no loop, C<0>
for looping indefinitely (default).


=item B<final_delay>

Force the delay (expressed in centiseconds) after the last frame. Each frame
ends with a delay until the next frame. The default is C<-1>, which is a
special value to tell the muxer to re-use the previous delay. In case of a
loop, you might want to customize this value to mark a pause for instance.

=back


For example, to encode a gif looping 10 times, with a 5 seconds delay between
the loops:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -loop 10 -final_delay 500 out.gif


Note 1: if you wish to extract the frames into separate GIF files, you need to
force the B<image2> muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:v gif -f image2 "out%d.gif"


Note 2: the GIF format has a very large time base: the delay between two frames
can therefore not be smaller than one centi second.



=head2 hash


Hash testing format.

This muxer computes and prints a cryptographic hash of all the input
audio and video frames. This can be used for equality checks without
having to do a complete binary comparison.

By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw audio and
video frames to raw video before computing the hash, but the output
of explicit conversions to other codecs can also be used. Timestamps
are ignored. It uses the SHA-256 cryptographic hash function by default,
but supports several other algorithms.

The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
I<algo>=I<hash>, where I<algo> is a short string representing
the hash function used, and I<hash> is a hexadecimal number
representing the computed hash.


=over 4


=item B<hash> I<algorithm>

Use the cryptographic hash function specified by the string I<algorithm>.
Supported values include C<MD5>, C<murmur3>, C<RIPEMD128>,
C<RIPEMD160>, C<RIPEMD256>, C<RIPEMD320>, C<SHA160>,
C<SHA224>, C<SHA256> (default), C<SHA512/224>, C<SHA512/256>,
C<SHA384>, C<SHA512>, C<CRC32> and C<adler32>.

=head3 Examples


To compute the SHA-256 hash of the input converted to raw audio and
video, and store it in the file F<out.sha256>:

To print an MD5 hash to stdout use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f hash -hash md5 -


See also the B<framehash> muxer.



=head2 hls


Apple HTTP Live Streaming muxer that segments MPEG-TS according to
the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) specification.

It creates a playlist file, and one or more segment files. The output filename
specifies the playlist filename.

By default, the muxer creates a file for each segment produced. These files
have the same name as the playlist, followed by a sequential number and a
.ts extension.

For example, to convert an input file with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<out0.ts>, F<out1.ts>, F<out2.ts>, etc.

See also the B<segment> muxer, which provides a more generic and
flexible implementation of a segmenter, and can be used to perform HLS
segmentation.


=head3 Options


This muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<hls_init_time> I<seconds>

Set the initial target segment length in seconds. Default value is I<0>.
Segment will be cut on the next key frame after this time has passed on the first m3u8 list.
After the initial playlist is filled B<ffmpeg> will cut segments
at duration equal to C<hls_time>


=item B<hls_time> I<seconds>

Set the target segment length in seconds. Default value is 2.
Segment will be cut on the next key frame after this time has passed.


=item B<hls_list_size> I<size>

Set the maximum number of playlist entries. If set to 0 the list file
will contain all the segments. Default value is 5.


=item B<hls_ts_options> I<options_list>

Set output format options using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters. Values containing C<:> special characters must be
escaped.


=item B<hls_wrap> I<wrap>

This is a deprecated option, you can use C<hls_list_size>
and C<hls_flags delete_segments> instead it

This option is useful to avoid to fill the disk with many segment
files, and limits the maximum number of segment files written to disk
to I<wrap>.



=item B<hls_start_number_source>

Start the playlist sequence number (C<#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE>) according to the specified source.
Unless C<hls_flags single_file> is set, it also specifies source of starting sequence numbers of
segment and subtitle filenames. In any case, if C<hls_flags append_list>
is set and read playlist sequence number is greater than the specified start sequence number,
then that value will be used as start value.

It accepts the following values:


=over 4



=item B<generic (default)>

Set the starting sequence numbers according to I<start_number> option value.


=item B<epoch>

The start number will be the seconds since epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00)


=item B<datetime>

The start number will be based on the current date/time as YYYYmmddHHMMSS. e.g. 20161231235759.


=back



=item B<start_number> I<number>

Start the playlist sequence number (C<#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE>) from the specified I<number>
when I<hls_start_number_source> value is I<generic>. (This is the default case.)
Unless C<hls_flags single_file> is set, it also specifies starting sequence numbers of segment and subtitle filenames.
Default value is 0.


=item B<hls_allow_cache> I<allowcache>

Explicitly set whether the client MAY (1) or MUST NOT (0) cache media segments.


=item B<hls_base_url> I<baseurl>

Append I<baseurl> to every entry in the playlist.
Useful to generate playlists with absolute paths.

Note that the playlist sequence number must be unique for each segment
and it is not to be confused with the segment filename sequence number
which can be cyclic, for example if the B<wrap> option is
specified.


=item B<hls_segment_filename> I<filename>

Set the segment filename. Unless C<hls_flags single_file> is set,
I<filename> is used as a string format with the segment number:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -hls_segment_filename 'file%03d.ts' out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<file000.ts>, F<file001.ts>, F<file002.ts>, etc.

I<filename> may contain full path or relative path specification,
but only the file name part without any path info will be contained in the m3u8 segment list.
Should a relative path be specified, the path of the created segment
files will be relative to the current working directory.
When use_localtime_mkdir is set, the whole expanded value of I<filename> will be written into the m3u8 segment list.



=item B<use_localtime>

Use strftime() on I<filename> to expand the segment filename with localtime.
The segment number is also available in this mode, but to use it, you need to specify second_level_segment_index
hls_flag and %%d will be the specifier.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -use_localtime 1 -hls_segment_filename 'file-%Y%m%d-%s.ts' out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<file-20160215-1455569023.ts>, F<file-20160215-1455569024.ts>, etc.
Note: On some systems/environments, the C<%s> specifier is not available. See
  C<strftime()> documentation.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -use_localtime 1 -hls_flags second_level_segment_index -hls_segment_filename 'file-%Y%m%d-%%04d.ts' out.m3u8

This example will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<file-20160215-0001.ts>, F<file-20160215-0002.ts>, etc.


=item B<use_localtime_mkdir>

Used together with -use_localtime, it will create all subdirectories which
is expanded in I<filename>.
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -use_localtime 1 -use_localtime_mkdir 1 -hls_segment_filename '%Y%m%d/file-%Y%m%d-%s.ts' out.m3u8

This example will create a directory 201560215 (if it does not exist), and then
produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<20160215/file-20160215-1455569023.ts>, F<20160215/file-20160215-1455569024.ts>, etc.

	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -use_localtime 1 -use_localtime_mkdir 1 -hls_segment_filename '%Y/%m/%d/file-%Y%m%d-%s.ts' out.m3u8

This example will create a directory hierarchy 2016/02/15 (if any of them do not exist), and then
produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and segment files:
F<2016/02/15/file-20160215-1455569023.ts>, F<2016/02/15/file-20160215-1455569024.ts>, etc.



=item B<hls_key_info_file> I<key_info_file>

Use the information in I<key_info_file> for segment encryption. The first
line of I<key_info_file> specifies the key URI written to the playlist. The
key URL is used to access the encryption key during playback. The second line
specifies the path to the key file used to obtain the key during the encryption
process. The key file is read as a single packed array of 16 octets in binary
format. The optional third line specifies the initialization vector (IV) as a
hexadecimal string to be used instead of the segment sequence number (default)
for encryption. Changes to I<key_info_file> will result in segment
encryption with the new key/IV and an entry in the playlist for the new key
URI/IV if C<hls_flags periodic_rekey> is enabled.

Key info file format:
	
	<key URI>
	<key file path>
	<IV> (optional)


Example key URIs:
	
	http://server/file.key
	/path/to/file.key
	file.key


Example key file paths:
	
	file.key
	/path/to/file.key


Example IV:
	
	0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF


Key info file example:
	
	http://server/file.key
	/path/to/file.key
	0123456789ABCDEF0123456789ABCDEF


Example shell script:
	
	#!/bin/sh
	BASE_URL=${1:-'.'}
	openssl rand 16 > file.key
	echo $BASE_URL/file.key > file.keyinfo
	echo file.key >> file.keyinfo
	echo $(openssl rand -hex 16) >> file.keyinfo
	ffmpeg -f lavfi -re -i testsrc -c:v h264 -hls_flags delete_segments \
	  -hls_key_info_file file.keyinfo out.m3u8



=item B<-hls_enc> I<enc>

Enable (1) or disable (0) the AES128 encryption.
When enabled every segment generated is encrypted and the encryption key
is saved as I<playlist name>.key.


=item B<-hls_enc_key> I<key>

Hex-coded 16byte key to encrypt the segments, by default it
is randomly generated.


=item B<-hls_enc_key_url> I<keyurl>

If set, I<keyurl> is prepended instead of I<baseurl> to the key filename
in the playlist.


=item B<-hls_enc_iv> I<iv>

Hex-coded 16byte initialization vector for every segment instead
of the autogenerated ones.


=item B<hls_segment_type> I<flags>

Possible values:

=item B<mpegts>

If this flag is set, the hls segment files will format to mpegts.
the mpegts files is used in all hls versions.


=item B<fmp4>

If this flag is set, the hls segment files will format to fragment mp4 looks like dash.
the fmp4 files is used in hls after version 7.


=back



=item B<hls_fmp4_init_filename> I<filename>

set filename to the fragment files header file, default filename is F<init.mp4>.


=item B<hls_flags> I<flags>

Possible values:


=over 4


=item B<single_file>

If this flag is set, the muxer will store all segments in a single MPEG-TS
file, and will use byte ranges in the playlist. HLS playlists generated with
this way will have the version number 4.
For example:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.nut -hls_flags single_file out.m3u8

Will produce the playlist, F<out.m3u8>, and a single segment file,
F<out.ts>.


=item B<delete_segments>

Segment files removed from the playlist are deleted after a period of time
equal to the duration of the segment plus the duration of the playlist.


=item B<append_list>

Append new segments into the end of old segment list,
and remove the C<#EXT-X-ENDLIST> from the old segment list.


=item B<round_durations>

Round the duration info in the playlist file segment info to integer
values, instead of using floating point.


=item B<discont_start>

Add the C<#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY> tag to the playlist, before the
first segment's information.


=item B<omit_endlist>

Do not append the C<EXT-X-ENDLIST> tag at the end of the playlist.


=item B<periodic_rekey>

The file specified by C<hls_key_info_file> will be checked periodically and
detect updates to the encryption info. Be sure to replace this file atomically,
including the file containing the AES encryption key.


=item B<split_by_time>

Allow segments to start on frames other than keyframes. This improves
behavior on some players when the time between keyframes is inconsistent,
but may make things worse on others, and can cause some oddities during
seeking. This flag should be used with the C<hls_time> option.


=item B<program_date_time>

Generate C<EXT-X-PROGRAM-DATE-TIME> tags.


=item B<second_level_segment_index>

Makes it possible to use segment indexes as %%d in hls_segment_filename expression
besides date/time values when use_localtime is on.
To get fixed width numbers with trailing zeroes, %%0xd format is available where x is the required width.


=item B<second_level_segment_size>

Makes it possible to use segment sizes (counted in bytes) as %%s in hls_segment_filename
expression besides date/time values when use_localtime is on.
To get fixed width numbers with trailing zeroes, %%0xs format is available where x is the required width.


=item B<second_level_segment_duration>

Makes it possible to use segment duration (calculated  in microseconds) as %%t in hls_segment_filename
expression besides date/time values when use_localtime is on.
To get fixed width numbers with trailing zeroes, %%0xt format is available where x is the required width.

=head2 image2


Image file muxer.

The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.

The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
produce sequentially numbered series of files.
The pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", this string
specifies the position of the characters representing a numbering in
the filenames. If the form "%0I<N>d" is used, the string
representing the number in each filename is 0-padded to I<N>
digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the pattern with
the string "%%".

If the pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified will contain the number 1, all the following
numbers will be sequential.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the image files to write.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will specify a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.
The pattern "img%%-%d.jpg" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
form F<img%-1.jpg>, F<img%-2.jpg>, ..., F<img%-10.jpg>,
etc.


=head3 Examples


The following example shows how to use B<ffmpeg> for creating a
sequence of files F<img-001.jpeg>, F<img-002.jpeg>, ...,
taking one image every second from the input video:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync cfr -r 1 -f image2 'img-%03d.jpeg'


Note that with B<ffmpeg>, if the format is not specified with the
C<-f> option and the output filename specifies an image file
format, the image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous
command can be written as:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync cfr -r 1 'img-%03d.jpeg'


Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to create a single image file
F<img.jpeg> from the start of the input video you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i in.avi -f image2 -frames:v 1 img.jpeg


The B<strftime> option allows you to expand the filename with
date and time information. Check the documentation of
the C<strftime()> function for the syntax.

For example to generate image files from the C<strftime()>
"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S" pattern, the following B<ffmpeg> command
can be used:
	
	ffmpeg -f v4l2 -r 1 -i /dev/video0 -f image2 -strftime 1 "%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S.jpg"



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<start_number>

Start the sequence from the specified number. Default value is 1.


=item B<update>

If set to 1, the filename will always be interpreted as just a
filename, not a pattern, and the corresponding file will be continuously
overwritten with new images. Default value is 0.


=item B<strftime>

If set to 1, expand the filename with date and time information from
C<strftime()>. Default value is 0.

=back


The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for
each of the YUV420P components. To read or write this image file format,
specify the name of the '.Y' file. The muxer will automatically open the
'.U' and '.V' files as required.


=head2 matroska


Matroska container muxer.

This muxer implements the matroska and webm container specs.


=head3 Metadata


The recognized metadata settings in this muxer are:


=over 4


=item B<title>

Set title name provided to a single track.


=item B<language>

Specify the language of the track in the Matroska languages form.

The language can be either the 3 letters bibliographic ISO-639-2 (ISO
639-2/B) form (like "fre" for French), or a language code mixed with a
country code for specialities in languages (like "fre-ca" for Canadian
French).


=item B<stereo_mode>

Set stereo 3D video layout of two views in a single video track.

The following values are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<mono>

video is not stereo

=item B<left_right>

Both views are arranged side by side, Left-eye view is on the left

=item B<bottom_top>

Both views are arranged in top-bottom orientation, Left-eye view is at bottom

=item B<top_bottom>

Both views are arranged in top-bottom orientation, Left-eye view is on top

=item B<checkerboard_rl>

Each view is arranged in a checkerboard interleaved pattern, Left-eye view being first

=item B<checkerboard_lr>

Each view is arranged in a checkerboard interleaved pattern, Right-eye view being first

=item B<row_interleaved_rl>

Each view is constituted by a row based interleaving, Right-eye view is first row

=item B<row_interleaved_lr>

Each view is constituted by a row based interleaving, Left-eye view is first row

=item B<col_interleaved_rl>

Both views are arranged in a column based interleaving manner, Right-eye view is first column

=item B<col_interleaved_lr>

	ffmpeg -i sample_left_right_clip.mpg -an -c:v libvpx -metadata stereo_mode=left_right -y stereo_clip.webm



=head3 Options


This muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<reserve_index_space>

By default, this muxer writes the index for seeking (called cues in Matroska
terms) at the end of the file, because it cannot know in advance how much space
to leave for the index at the beginning of the file. However for some use cases
-- e.g.  streaming where seeking is possible but slow -- it is useful to put the
index at the beginning of the file.

If this option is set to a non-zero value, the muxer will reserve a given amount
of space in the file header and then try to write the cues there when the muxing
finishes. If the available space does not suffice, muxing will fail. A safe size
for most use cases should be about 50kB per hour of video.

Note that cues are only written if the output is seekable and this option will
have no effect if it is not.

=back




=head2 md5


MD5 testing format.

This is a variant of the B<hash> muxer. Unlike that muxer, it
defaults to using the MD5 hash function.


=head3 Examples


To compute the MD5 hash of the input converted to raw
audio and video, and store it in the file F<out.md5>:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5


You can print the MD5 to stdout with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -


See also the B<hash> and B<framemd5> muxers.


=head2 mov, mp4, ismv


MOV/MP4/ISMV (Smooth Streaming) muxer.

The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a MOV/MP4
file has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location
(written at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for
better playback by adding I<faststart> to the I<movflags>, or
using the B<qt-faststart> tool). A fragmented
file consists of a number of fragments, where packets and metadata
about these packets are stored together. Writing a fragmented
file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if the
writing is interrupted (while a normal MOV/MP4 is undecodable if
it is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
very long files (since writing normal MOV/MP4 files stores info about
every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
is that it is less compatible with other applications.


=head3 Options


Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
how to cut the file into fragments:


=over 4


=item B<-moov_size> I<bytes>

Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file instead of placing the
moov atom at the end. If the space reserved is insufficient, muxing will fail.

=item B<-movflags frag_keyframe>

Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.

=item B<-frag_duration> I<duration>

Create fragments that are I<duration> microseconds long.

=item B<-frag_size> I<size>

Create fragments that contain up to I<size> bytes of payload data.

=item B<-movflags frag_custom>

Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
calling C<av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)> to write a fragment with
the packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
applications integrating libavformat, not from B<ffmpeg>.)

=item B<-min_frag_duration> I<duration>

Don't create fragments that are shorter than I<duration> microseconds long.

=back


If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when
one of the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
C<-min_frag_duration>, which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
conditions to apply.

Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
through a few other options:


=over 4


=item B<-movflags empty_moov>

Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file, without
describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair is written
at the start of the file, as a normal MOV/MP4 file, containing only
a short portion of the file. With this option set, there is no initial
mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the tracks but has
a zero duration.

This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-movflags separate_moof>

Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track. Normally,
packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which is slightly
more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer writes one moof/mdat
pair for each track, making it easier to separate tracks.

This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming) files.

=item B<-movflags faststart>

Run a second pass moving the index (moov atom) to the beginning of the file.
This operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations such
as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.

=item B<-movflags rtphint>

Add RTP hinting tracks to the output file.

=item B<-movflags disable_chpl>

Disable Nero chapter markers (chpl atom).  Normally, both Nero chapters
and a QuickTime chapter track are written to the file. With this option
set, only the QuickTime chapter track will be written. Nero chapters can
cause failures when the file is reprocessed with certain tagging programs, like
mp3Tag 2.61a and iTunes 11.3, most likely other versions are affected as well.

=item B<-movflags omit_tfhd_offset>

Do not write any absolute base_data_offset in tfhd atoms. This avoids
tying fragments to absolute byte positions in the file/streams.

=item B<-movflags default_base_moof>

Similarly to the omit_tfhd_offset, this flag avoids writing the
absolute base_data_offset field in tfhd atoms, but does so by using
the new default-base-is-moof flag instead. This flag is new from
14496-12:2012. This may make the fragments easier to parse in certain
circumstances (avoiding basing track fragment location calculations
on the implicit end of the previous track fragment).

=item B<-write_tmcd>

Specify C<on> to force writing a timecode track, C<off> to disable it
and C<auto> to write a timecode track only for mov and mp4 output (default).

=item B<-movflags negative_cts_offsets>

Enables utilization of version 1 of the CTTS box, in which the CTS offsets can
be negative. This enables the initial sample to have DTS/CTS of zero, and
reduces the need for edit lists for some cases such as video tracks with
B-frames. Additionally, eases conformance with the DASH-IF interoperability
guidelines.

=back



=head3 Example


Smooth Streaming content can be pushed in real time to a publishing
point on IIS with this muxer. Example:
	
	ffmpeg -re <<normal input/transcoding options>> -movflags isml+frag_keyframe -f ismv http://server/publishingpoint.isml/Streams(Encoder1)



=head3 Audible AAX


Audible AAX files are encrypted M4B files, and they can be decrypted by specifying a 4 byte activation secret.
	
	ffmpeg -activation_bytes 1CEB00DA -i test.aax -vn -c:a copy output.mp4



=head2 mp3


The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with the following optional features:

=over 4


=item *

An ID3v2 metadata header at the beginning (enabled by default). Versions 2.3 and
2.4 are supported, the C<id3v2_version> private option controls which one is
used (3 or 4). Setting C<id3v2_version> to 0 disables the ID3v2 header
completely.

The muxer supports writing attached pictures (APIC frames) to the ID3v2 header.
The pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a single
packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will correspond to a
single APIC frame.  The stream metadata tags I<title> and I<comment> map
to APIC I<description> and I<picture type> respectively. See
E<lt>B<http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames>E<gt> for allowed picture types.

Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the muxer will
buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It is therefore advised
to provide the pictures as soon as possible to avoid excessive buffering.


=item *

A Xing/LAME frame right after the ID3v2 header (if present). It is enabled by
default, but will be written only if the output is seekable. The
C<write_xing> private option can be used to disable it.  The frame contains
various information that may be useful to the decoder, like the audio duration
or encoder delay.


=item *

A legacy ID3v1 tag at the end of the file (disabled by default). It may be
enabled with the C<write_id3v1> private option, but as its capabilities are
very limited, its usage is not recommended.

=back


Examples:

Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 out.mp3


To attach a picture to an mp3 file select both the audio and the picture stream
with C<map>:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -i cover.png -c copy -map 0 -map 1
	-metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (Front)" out.mp3


Write a "clean" MP3 without any extra features:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.wav -write_xing 0 -id3v2_version 0 out.mp3

=item B<store_user_comments> I<bool>

Set if user comments should be stored if available or never.
IRT D-10 does not allow user comments. The default is thus to write them for

=head2 null


Null muxer.

This muxer does not generate any output file, it is mainly useful for
testing or benchmarking purposes.

For example to benchmark decoding with B<ffmpeg> you can use the
command:
	
	ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null out.null


Note that the above command does not read or write the F<out.null>
file, but specifying the output file is required by the B<ffmpeg>
syntax.

Alternatively you can write the command as:
	
	ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null -

=item B<-syncpoints> I<flags>

Change the syncpoint usage in nut:

=over 4


=item I<default> B<use the normal low-overhead seeking aids.>


=item I<none> B<do not use the syncpoints at all, reducing the overhead but making the stream non-seekable;>

    Use of this option is not recommended, as the resulting files are very damage
    sensitive and seeking is not possible. Also in general the overhead from
    syncpoints is negligible. Note, -C<write_index> 0 can be used to disable
    all growing data tables, allowing to mux endless streams with limited memory
    and without these disadvantages.

=item I<timestamped> B<extend the syncpoint with a wallclock field.>

Ogg container muxer.


=over 4


=item B<-page_duration> I<duration>

Preferred page duration, in microseconds. The muxer will attempt to create
pages that are approximately I<duration> microseconds long. This allows the
user to compromise between seek granularity and container overhead. The default
is 1 second. A value of 0 will fill all segments, making pages as large as
possible. A value of 1 will effectively use 1 packet-per-page in most
situations, giving a small seek granularity at the cost of additional container
overhead.

=item B<-serial_offset> I<value>

Serial value from which to set the streams serial number.
Setting it to different and sufficiently large values ensures that the produced
ogg files can be safely chained.


=back




=head2 segment, stream_segment, ssegment


Basic stream segmenter.

This muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of nearly
fixed duration. Output filename pattern can be set in a fashion
similar to B<image2>, or by using a C<strftime> template if
the B<strftime> option is enabled.

C<stream_segment> is a variant of the muxer used to write to
streaming output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers,
and is recommended for outputting e.g. to MPEG transport stream segments.
C<ssegment> is a shorter alias for C<stream_segment>.

Every segment starts with a keyframe of the selected reference stream,
which is set through the B<reference_stream> option.

Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file, you need to
make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting times
expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the new
segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
time.

The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.

Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
the option I<segment_list>. The list type is specified by the
I<segment_list_type> option. The entry filenames in the segment
list are set by default to the basename of the corresponding segment
files.

See also the B<hls> muxer, which provides a more specific
implementation for HLS segmentation.


=head3 Options


The segment muxer supports the following options:


=over 4


=item B<increment_tc> I<1|0>

if set to C<1>, increment timecode between each segment
If this is selected, the input need to have
a timecode in the first video stream. Default value is
C<0>.


=item B<reference_stream> I<specifier>

Set the reference stream, as specified by the string I<specifier>.
If I<specifier> is set to C<auto>, the reference is chosen
automatically. Otherwise it must be a stream specifier (see the ``Stream
specifiers'' chapter in the ffmpeg manual) which specifies the
reference stream. The default value is C<auto>.


=item B<segment_format> I<format>

Override the inner container format, by default it is guessed by the filename
extension.


=item B<segment_format_options> I<options_list>

Set output format options using a :-separated list of key=value
parameters. Values containing the C<:> special character must be
escaped.


=item B<segment_list> I<name>

Generate also a listfile named I<name>. If not specified no
listfile is generated.


=item B<segment_list_flags> I<flags>

Set flags affecting the segment list generation.

It currently supports the following flags:

=over 4


=item B<cache>

Allow caching (only affects M3U8 list files).


=item B<live>

Allow live-friendly file generation.

=back



=item B<segment_list_size> I<size>

Update the list file so that it contains at most I<size>
segments. If 0 the list file will contain all the segments. Default
value is 0.


=item B<segment_list_entry_prefix> I<prefix>

Prepend I<prefix> to each entry. Useful to generate absolute paths.
By default no prefix is applied.


=item B<segment_list_type> I<type>

Select the listing format.

The following values are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<flat>

Generate a flat list for the created segments, one segment per line.


=item B<csv, ext>

Generate a list for the created segments, one segment per line,
each line matching the format (comma-separated values):
	
	<segment_filename>,<segment_start_time>,<segment_end_time>


I<segment_filename> is the name of the output file generated by the
muxer according to the provided pattern. CSV escaping (according to
RFC4180) is applied if required.

I<segment_start_time> and I<segment_end_time> specify
the segment start and end time expressed in seconds.

A list file with the suffix C<".csv"> or C<".ext"> will
auto-select this format.

B<ext> is deprecated in favor or B<csv>.


=item B<ffconcat>

Generate an ffconcat file for the created segments. The resulting file
can be read using the FFmpeg B<concat> demuxer.

A list file with the suffix C<".ffcat"> or C<".ffconcat"> will
auto-select this format.


=item B<m3u8>

Generate an extended M3U8 file, version 3, compliant with
E<lt>B<http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming>E<gt>.

A list file with the suffix C<".m3u8"> will auto-select this format.

=back


If not specified the type is guessed from the list file name suffix.


=item B<segment_time> I<time>

Set segment duration to I<time>, the value must be a duration
specification. Default value is "2". See also the
B<segment_times> option.

Note that splitting may not be accurate, unless you force the
reference stream key-frames at the given time. See the introductory
notice and the examples below.


=item B<segment_atclocktime> I<1|0>

If set to "1" split at regular clock time intervals starting from 00:00
o'clock. The I<time> value specified in B<segment_time> is
used for setting the length of the splitting interval.

For example with B<segment_time> set to "900" this makes it possible
to create files at 12:00 o'clock, 12:15, 12:30, etc.

Default value is "0".


=item B<segment_clocktime_offset> I<duration>

Delay the segment splitting times with the specified duration when using
B<segment_atclocktime>.

For example with B<segment_time> set to "900" and
B<segment_clocktime_offset> set to "300" this makes it possible to
create files at 12:05, 12:20, 12:35, etc.

Default value is "0".


=item B<segment_clocktime_wrap_duration> I<duration>

Force the segmenter to only start a new segment if a packet reaches the muxer
within the specified duration after the segmenting clock time. This way you
can make the segmenter more resilient to backward local time jumps, such as
leap seconds or transition to standard time from daylight savings time.

Default is the maximum possible duration which means starting a new segment
regardless of the elapsed time since the last clock time.


=item B<segment_time_delta> I<delta>

Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
segment, expressed as a duration specification. Default value is "0".

When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
PTS satisfies the relation:
	
	PTS >= start_time - time_delta


This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
split at GOP boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before the
specified split time.

In particular may be used in combination with the F<ffmpeg> option
I<force_key_frames>. The key frame times specified by
I<force_key_frames> may not be set accurately because of rounding
issues, with the consequence that a key frame time may result set just
before the specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
1/(2*I<frame_rate>) should address the worst case mismatch between
the specified time and the time set by I<force_key_frames>.


=item B<segment_times> I<times>

Specify a list of split points. I<times> contains a list of comma
separated duration specifications, in increasing order. See also
the B<segment_time> option.


=item B<segment_frames> I<frames>

Specify a list of split video frame numbers. I<frames> contains a
list of comma separated integer numbers, in increasing order.

This option specifies to start a new segment whenever a reference
stream key frame is found and the sequential number (starting from 0)
of the frame is greater or equal to the next value in the list.


=item B<segment_wrap> I<limit>

Wrap around segment index once it reaches I<limit>.


=item B<segment_start_number> I<number>

Set the sequence number of the first segment. Defaults to C<0>.


=item B<strftime> I<1|0>

Use the C<strftime> function to define the name of the new
segments to write. If this is selected, the output segment name must
contain a C<strftime> function template. Default value is
C<0>.


=item B<break_non_keyframes> I<1|0>

If enabled, allow segments to start on frames other than keyframes. This
improves behavior on some players when the time between keyframes is
inconsistent, but may make things worse on others, and can cause some oddities
during seeking. Defaults to C<0>.


=item B<reset_timestamps> I<1|0>

Reset timestamps at the beginning of each segment, so that each segment
will start with near-zero timestamps. It is meant to ease the playback
of the generated segments. May not work with some combinations of
muxers/codecs. It is set to C<0> by default.


=item B<initial_offset> I<offset>

Specify timestamp offset to apply to the output packet timestamps. The
argument must be a time duration specification, and defaults to 0.


=item B<write_empty_segments> I<1|0>

If enabled, write an empty segment if there are no packets during the period a
segment would usually span. Otherwise, the segment will be filled with the next
packet written. Defaults to C<0>.

=head2 smoothstreaming


Smooth Streaming muxer generates a set of files (Manifest, chunks) suitable for serving with conventional web server.


=over 4


=item B<window_size>

Specify the number of fragments kept in the manifest. Default 0 (keep all).


=item B<extra_window_size>

Specify the number of fragments kept outside of the manifest before removing from disk. Default 5.


=item B<lookahead_count>

Specify the number of lookahead fragments. Default 2.


=item B<min_frag_duration>

Specify the minimum fragment duration (in microseconds). Default 5000000.


=item B<remove_at_exit>

Specify whether to remove all fragments when finished. Default 0 (do not remove).


=back




=head2 fifo


The fifo pseudo-muxer allows the separation of encoding and muxing by using
first-in-first-out queue and running the actual muxer in a separate thread. This
is especially useful in combination with the B<tee> muxer and can be used to
send data to several destinations with different reliability/writing speed/latency.

API users should be aware that callback functions (interrupt_callback,
io_open and io_close) used within its AVFormatContext must be thread-safe.

The behavior of the fifo muxer if the queue fills up or if the output fails is
selectable,


=over 4



=item *

output can be transparently restarted with configurable delay between retries
based on real time or time of the processed stream.


=item *

encoding can be blocked during temporary failure, or continue transparently
dropping packets in case fifo queue fills up.


=back



=over 4



=item B<fifo_format>

Specify the format name. Useful if it cannot be guessed from the
output name suffix.


=item B<queue_size>

Specify size of the queue (number of packets). Default value is 60.


=item B<format_opts>

Specify format options for the underlying muxer. Muxer options can be specified
as a list of I<key>=I<value> pairs separated by ':'.


=item B<drop_pkts_on_overflow> I<bool>

If set to 1 (true), in case the fifo queue fills up, packets will be dropped
rather than blocking the encoder. This makes it possible to continue streaming without
delaying the input, at the cost of omitting part of the stream. By default
this option is set to 0 (false), so in such cases the encoder will be blocked
until the muxer processes some of the packets and none of them is lost.


=item B<attempt_recovery> I<bool>

If failure occurs, attempt to recover the output. This is especially useful
when used with network output, since it makes it possible to restart streaming transparently.
By default this option is set to 0 (false).


=item B<max_recovery_attempts>

Sets maximum number of successive unsuccessful recovery attempts after which
the output fails permanently. By default this option is set to 0 (unlimited).


=item B<recovery_wait_time> I<duration>

Waiting time before the next recovery attempt after previous unsuccessful
recovery attempt. Default value is 5 seconds.


=item B<recovery_wait_streamtime> I<bool>

If set to 0 (false), the real time is used when waiting for the recovery
attempt (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least
recovery_wait_time seconds).
If set to 1 (true), the time of the processed stream is taken into account
instead (i.e. the recovery will be attempted after at least I<recovery_wait_time>
seconds of the stream is omitted).
By default, this option is set to 0 (false).


=item B<recover_any_error> I<bool>

If set to 1 (true), recovery will be attempted regardless of type of the error
causing the failure. By default this option is set to 0 (false) and in case of
certain (usually permanent) errors the recovery is not attempted even when
I<attempt_recovery> is set to 1.


=item B<restart_with_keyframe> I<bool>

Specify whether to wait for the keyframe after recovering from
queue overflow or failure. This option is set to 0 (false) by default.


=back

=head2 tee


The tee muxer can be used to write the same data to several files or any
other kind of muxer. It can be used, for example, to both stream a video to
the network and save it to disk at the same time.

It is different from specifying several outputs to the B<ffmpeg>
command-line tool because the audio and video data will be encoded only once
with the tee muxer; encoding can be a very expensive process. It is not
useful when using the libavformat API directly because it is then possible
to feed the same packets to several muxers directly.


=over 4



=item B<use_fifo> I<bool>

If set to 1, slave outputs will be processed in separate thread using B<fifo>
muxer. This allows to compensate for different speed/latency/reliability of
outputs and setup transparent recovery. By default this feature is turned off.


=item B<fifo_options>

Options to pass to fifo pseudo-muxer instances. See B<fifo>.


=back


The slave outputs are specified in the file name given to the muxer,
separated by '|'. If any of the slave name contains the '|' separator,
leading or trailing spaces or any special character, it must be
escaped (see B<the "Quoting and escaping"
section in the ffmpeg-utils(1) manual>).

Muxer options can be specified for each slave by prepending them as a list of
I<key>=I<value> pairs separated by ':', between square brackets. If
the options values contain a special character or the ':' separator, they
must be escaped; note that this is a second level escaping.

The following special options are also recognized:

=over 4


=item B<f>

Specify the format name. Useful if it cannot be guessed from the
output name suffix.


=item B<bsfs[/>I<spec>B<]>

Specify a list of bitstream filters to apply to the specified
output.


=item B<use_fifo> I<bool>

This allows to override tee muxer use_fifo option for individual slave muxer.


=item B<fifo_options>

This allows to override tee muxer fifo_options for individual slave muxer.
See B<fifo>.

It is possible to specify to which streams a given bitstream filter
applies, by appending a stream specifier to the option separated by
C</>. I<spec> must be a stream specifier (see B<Format
stream specifiers>).  If the stream specifier is not specified, the
bitstream filters will be applied to all streams in the output.

Several bitstream filters can be specified, separated by ",".


=item B<select>

Select the streams that should be mapped to the slave output,
specified by a stream specifier. If not specified, this defaults to
all the input streams. You may use multiple stream specifiers
separated by commas (C<,>) e.g.: C<a:0,v>


=item B<onfail>

Specify behaviour on output failure. This can be set to either C<abort> (which is
default) or C<ignore>. C<abort> will cause whole process to fail in case of failure
on this slave output. C<ignore> will ignore failure on this output, so other outputs
will continue without being affected.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Encode something and both archive it in a WebM file and stream it
as MPEG-TS over UDP (the streams need to be explicitly mapped):
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -c:v libx264 -c:a mp2 -f tee -map 0:v -map 0:a
	  "archive-20121107.mkv|[f=mpegts]udp://10.0.1.255:1234/"



=item *

As above, but continue streaming even if output to local file fails
(for example local drive fills up):
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -c:v libx264 -c:a mp2 -f tee -map 0:v -map 0:a
	  "[onfail=ignore]archive-20121107.mkv|[f=mpegts]udp://10.0.1.255:1234/"



=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> to encode the input, and send the output
to three different destinations. The C<dump_extra> bitstream
filter is used to add extradata information to all the output video
keyframes packets, as requested by the MPEG-TS format. The select
option is applied to F<out.aac> in order to make it contain only
audio packets.
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -map 0 -flags +global_header -c:v libx264 -c:a aac
	       -f tee "[bsfs/v=dump_extra]out.ts|[movflags=+faststart]out.mp4|[select=a]out.aac"



=item *

As below, but select only stream C<a:1> for the audio output. Note
that a second level escaping must be performed, as ":" is a special
character used to separate options.
	
	ffmpeg -i ... -map 0 -flags +global_header -c:v libx264 -c:a aac
	       -f tee "[bsfs/v=dump_extra]out.ts|[movflags=+faststart]out.mp4|[select=\'a:1\']out.aac"


=back


Note: some codecs may need different options depending on the output format;
the auto-detection of this can not work with the tee muxer. The main example
is the B<global_header> flag.

=head1 METADATA


FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple UTF-8-encoded
INI-like text file and then load it back using the metadata muxer/demuxer.

The file format is as follows:

=over 4



=item 1.

A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided into sections,
each on its own line.


=item 2.

The header is a B<;FFMETADATA> string, followed by a version number (now 1).


=item 3.

Metadata tags are of the form B<key=value>


=item 4.

Immediately after header follows global metadata


=item 5.

After global metadata there may be sections with per-stream/per-chapter
metadata.


=item 6.

A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. STREAM or CHAPTER) in
brackets (B<[>, B<]>) and ends with next section or end of file.


=item 7.

At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional timebase to be
used for start/end values. It must be in form
B<TIMEBASE=>I<num>B</>I<den>, where I<num> and I<den> are
integers. If the timebase is missing then start/end times are assumed to
be in milliseconds.

Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in form
B<START=>I<num>, B<END=>I<num>, where I<num> is a positive
integer.


=item 8.

Empty lines and lines starting with B<;> or B<#> are ignored.


=item 9.

Metadata keys or values containing special characters (B<=>, B<;>,
B<#>, B<\> and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash B<\>.


=item 10.

Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. B<foo = bar>) is considered to be
a part of the tag (in the example above key is B<foo> , value is
 B<bar>).

=back


A ffmetadata file might look like this:
	
	;FFMETADATA1
	title=bike\\shed
	;this is a comment
	artist=FFmpeg troll team
	
	[CHAPTER]
	TIMEBASE=1/1000
	START=0
	#chapter ends at 0:01:00
	END=60000
	title=chapter \#1
	[STREAM]
	title=multi\
	line


By using the ffmetadata muxer and demuxer it is possible to extract
metadata from an input file to an ffmetadata file, and then transcode
the file into an output file with the edited ffmetadata file.

Extracting an ffmetadata file with F<ffmpeg> goes as follows:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -f ffmetadata FFMETADATAFILE


Reinserting edited metadata information from the FFMETADATAFILE file can
be done as:
	
	ffmpeg -i INPUT -i FFMETADATAFILE -map_metadata 1 -codec copy OUTPUT



=head1 PROTOCOL OPTIONS


The libavformat library provides some generic global options, which
can be set on all the protocols. In addition each protocol may support
so-called private options, which are specific for that component.

Options may be set by specifying -I<option> I<value> in the
FFmpeg tools, or by setting the value explicitly in the
C<AVFormatContext> options or using the F<libavutil/opt.h> API
for programmatic use.

The list of supported options follows:


=over 4


=item B<protocol_whitelist> I<list> B<(>I<input>B<)>

Set a ","-separated list of allowed protocols. "ALL" matches all protocols. Protocols
prefixed by "-" are disabled.
All protocols are allowed by default but protocols used by an another
protocol (nested protocols) are restricted to a per protocol subset.

=back




=head1 PROTOCOLS


Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg that enable access to
resources that require specific protocols.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-protocols".

You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
"--disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "--enable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
"--disable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>".

The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.

All protocols accept the following options:


=over 4


=item B<rw_timeout>

Maximum time to wait for (network) read/write operations to complete,
in microseconds.

=back


A description of the currently available protocols follows.


=head2 async


Asynchronous data filling wrapper for input stream.

Fill data in a background thread, to decouple I/O operation from demux thread.

	
	async:<URL>
	async:http://host/resource
	async:cache:http://host/resource



=head2 bluray


Read BluRay playlist.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<angle>

BluRay angle


=item B<chapter>

Start chapter (1...N)


=item B<playlist>

Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)


=back


Examples:

Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:
	
	bluray:/mnt/bluray


Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from chapter 2:
	
	-playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray



=head2 cache


Caching wrapper for input stream.

Cache the input stream to temporary file. It brings seeking capability to live streams.

	
	cache:<URL>



=head2 concat


Physical concatenation protocol.

Read and seek from many resources in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.

A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
	
	concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>


where I<URL1>, I<URL2>, ..., I<URLN> are the urls of the
resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol.

For example to read a sequence of files F<split1.mpeg>,
F<split2.mpeg>, F<split3.mpeg> with B<ffplay> use the
command:
	
	ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg


Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for
many shells.


=head2 crypto


AES-encrypted stream reading protocol.

The accepted options are:

=over 4


=item B<key>

Set the AES decryption key binary block from given hexadecimal representation.


=item B<iv>

Set the AES decryption initialization vector binary block from given hexadecimal representation.

=back


Accepted URL formats:
	
	crypto:<URL>
	crypto+<URL>



=head2 data


Data in-line in the URI. See E<lt>B<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme>E<gt>.

For example, to convert a GIF file given inline with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODdhCAAIAMIEAAAAAAAA//8AAP//AP///////////////ywAAAAACAAIAAADF0gEDLojDgdGiJdJqUX02iB4E8Q9jUMkADs=" smiley.png



=head2 file


File access protocol.

Read from or write to a file.

A file URL can have the form:
	
	file:<filename>


where I<filename> is the path of the file to read.

An URL that does not have a protocol prefix will be assumed to be a
file URL. Depending on the build, an URL that looks like a Windows
path with the drive letter at the beginning will also be assumed to be
a file URL (usually not the case in builds for unix-like systems).

For example to read from a file F<input.mpeg> with B<ffmpeg>
use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<truncate>

Truncate existing files on write, if set to 1. A value of 0 prevents
truncating. Default value is 1.


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable for files on slow medium.

=back



=head2 ftp


FTP (File Transfer Protocol).

Read from or write to remote resources using FTP protocol.

Following syntax is required.
	
	ftp://[user[:password]@]server[:port]/path/to/remote/resource.mpeg


This protocol accepts the following options.


=over 4


=item B<timeout>

Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.


=item B<ftp-anonymous-password>

Password used when login as anonymous user. Typically an e-mail address
should be used.


=item B<ftp-write-seekable>

Control seekability of connection during encoding. If set to 1 the
resource is supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not
to be seekable. Default value is 0.

=back


NOTE: Protocol can be used as output, but it is recommended to not do
it, unless special care is taken (tests, customized server configuration
etc.). Different FTP servers behave in different way during seek
operation. ff* tools may produce incomplete content due to server limitations.

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<follow>

If set to 1, the protocol will retry reading at the end of the file, allowing
reading files that still are being written. In order for this to terminate,
you either need to use the rw_timeout option, or use the interrupt callback
(for API users).


=back



=head2 gopher


Gopher protocol.


=head2 hls


Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+I<proto>" after the hls URI scheme name, where I<proto>
is either "file" or "http".

	
	hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
	hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8


Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work
just as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.
To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the
m3u8 files.


=head2 http


HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<seekable>

Control seekability of connection. If set to 1 the resource is
supposed to be seekable, if set to 0 it is assumed not to be seekable,
if set to -1 it will try to autodetect if it is seekable. Default
value is -1.


=item B<chunked_post>

If set to 1 use chunked Transfer-Encoding for posts, default is 1.


=item B<content_type>

Set a specific content type for the POST messages or for listen mode.


=item B<http_proxy>

set HTTP proxy to tunnel through e.g. http://example.com:1234


=item B<headers>

Set custom HTTP headers, can override built in default headers. The
value must be a string encoding the headers.


=item B<multiple_requests>

Use persistent connections if set to 1, default is 0.


=item B<post_data>

Set custom HTTP post data.


=item B<user_agent>

Override the User-Agent header. If not specified the protocol will use a
string describing the libavformat build. ("Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>")


=item B<user-agent>

This is a deprecated option, you can use user_agent instead it.


=item B<timeout>

Set timeout in microseconds of socket I/O operations used by the underlying low level
operation. By default it is set to -1, which means that the timeout is
not specified.


=item B<reconnect_at_eof>

If set then eof is treated like an error and causes reconnection, this is useful
for live / endless streams.


=item B<reconnect_streamed>

If set then even streamed/non seekable streams will be reconnected on errors.


=item B<reconnect_delay_max>

Sets the maximum delay in seconds after which to give up reconnecting


=item B<mime_type>

Export the MIME type.


=item B<icy>

If set to 1 request ICY (SHOUTcast) metadata from the server. If the server
supports this, the metadata has to be retrieved by the application by reading
the B<icy_metadata_headers> and B<icy_metadata_packet> options.
The default is 1.


=item B<icy_metadata_headers>

If the server supports ICY metadata, this contains the ICY-specific HTTP reply
headers, separated by newline characters.


=item B<icy_metadata_packet>

If the server supports ICY metadata, and B<icy> was set to 1, this
contains the last non-empty metadata packet sent by the server. It should be
polled in regular intervals by applications interested in mid-stream metadata
updates.


=item B<cookies>

Set the cookies to be sent in future requests. The format of each cookie is the
same as the value of a Set-Cookie HTTP response field. Multiple cookies can be
delimited by a newline character.


=item B<offset>

Set initial byte offset.


=item B<end_offset>

Try to limit the request to bytes preceding this offset.


=item B<method>

When used as a client option it sets the HTTP method for the request.

When used as a server option it sets the HTTP method that is going to be
expected from the client(s).
If the expected and the received HTTP method do not match the client will
be given a Bad Request response.
When unset the HTTP method is not checked for now. This will be replaced by
autodetection in the future.


=item B<listen>

If set to 1 enables experimental HTTP server. This can be used to send data when
used as an output option, or read data from a client with HTTP POST when used as
an input option.
If set to 2 enables experimental multi-client HTTP server. This is not yet implemented
in ffmpeg.c or ffserver.c and thus must not be used as a command line option.
	
	# Server side (sending):
	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -c copy -listen 1 -f ogg http://<server>:<port>
	
	# Client side (receiving):
	ffmpeg -i http://<server>:<port> -c copy somefile.ogg
	
	# Client can also be done with wget:
	wget http://<server>:<port> -O somefile.ogg
	
	# Server side (receiving):
	ffmpeg -listen 1 -i http://<server>:<port> -c copy somefile.ogg
	
	# Client side (sending):
	ffmpeg -i somefile.ogg -chunked_post 0 -c copy -f ogg http://<server>:<port>
	
	# Client can also be done with wget:
	wget --post-file=somefile.ogg http://<server>:<port>



=back



=head3 HTTP Cookies


Some HTTP requests will be denied unless cookie values are passed in with the
request. The B<cookies> option allows these cookies to be specified. At
the very least, each cookie must specify a value along with a path and domain.
HTTP requests that match both the domain and path will automatically include the
cookie value in the HTTP Cookie header field. Multiple cookies can be delimited
by a newline.

The required syntax to play a stream specifying a cookie is:
	
	ffplay -cookies "nlqptid=nltid=tsn; path=/; domain=somedomain.com;" http://somedomain.com/somestream.m3u8



=head2 Icecast


Icecast protocol (stream to Icecast servers)

"Lavf/E<lt>versionE<gt>" will be used.


=item B<password>

Set the Icecast mountpoint password.


=item B<content_type>

Set the stream content type. This must be set if it is different from
audio/mpeg.


=item B<legacy_icecast>

This enables support for Icecast versions E<lt> 2.4.0, that do not support the
HTTP PUT method but the SOURCE method.


=back


	
	icecast://[<username>[:<password>]@]<server>:<port>/<mountpoint>



=head2 mmst


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.


=head2 mmsh


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

The required syntax is:
	
	mmsh://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>]



=head2 md5


MD5 output protocol.

Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can
be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

Some examples follow.
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:


Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.


=head2 pipe


UNIX pipe access protocol.

Read and write from UNIX pipes.

The accepted syntax is:
	
	pipe:[<number>]


I<number> is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the
pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If I<number>
is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used
for writing, stdin for reading.

For example to read from stdin with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
	# ...this is the same as...
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:


For writing to stdout with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
	# ...this is the same as...
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi


This protocol accepts the following options:


=over 4


=item B<blocksize>

Set I/O operation maximum block size, in bytes. Default value is
C<INT_MAX>, which results in not limiting the requested block size.
Setting this value reasonably low improves user termination request reaction
time, which is valuable if data transmission is slow.

=back


Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.


=head2 prompeg


Pro-MPEG Code of Practice #3 Release 2 FEC protocol.

The Pro-MPEG CoP#3 FEC is a 2D parity-check forward error correction mechanism
for MPEG-2 Transport Streams sent over RTP.

the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
(e.g. F</ondemand/>, F</flash/live/>, etc.). You can override
the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_app> option, too.


=item B<playpath>

It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to the
application specified in I<app>, may be prefixed by "mp4:". You

followed by a colon. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for
FALSE or TRUE, respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or
1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may
be named, by prefixing the type with 'N' and specifying the name before
the value (i.e. C<NB:myFlag:1>). This option may be used multiple
times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences.


=item B<rtmp_flashver>

Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default

=head2 librtmp rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte


Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through
librtmp.

Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
"--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
protocol.

This protocol provides most client functions and a few server
functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT),
encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled
variants of these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

The required syntax is:
	
	<rtmp_proto>://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>] <options>


where I<rtmp_proto> is one of the strings "rtmp", "rtmpt", "rtmpe",
"rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each RTMP variant, and
I<server>, I<port>, I<app> and I<playpath> have the same
meaning as specified for the RTMP native protocol.
I<options> contains a list of space-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
B<ffmpeg>:

set to 1) or to a default remote address (if set to 0).


=item B<localport=>I<n>

Set the local RTP port to I<n>.

This is a deprecated option. Instead, B<localrtpport> should be
used.


=back


Important notes:


=over 4



=item 1.

If B<rtcpport> is not set the RTCP port will be set to the RTP
port value plus 1.


=item 2.

If B<localrtpport> (the local RTP port) is not set any available
port will be used for the local RTP and RTCP ports.


=item 3.

If B<localrtcpport> (the local RTCP port) is not set it will be
set to the local RTP port value plus 1.

=back



=head2 rtsp


Real-Time Streaming Protocol.

RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a demuxer
and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred
over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with
data transferred over RDT).

The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's
E<lt>B<https://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server>E<gt>).

The required syntax for a RTSP url is:
	
	rtsp://<hostname>[:<port>]/<path>


Options can be set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line, or set in code via C<AVOption>s or in
C<avformat_open_input>.

The following options are supported.


=over 4


=item B<initial_pause>

=item B<udp>

Use UDP as lower transport protocol.


=item B<tcp>

Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
transport protocol.


=item B<udp_multicast>

Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.


=item B<http>

Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
passing proxies.

=back


Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they are
tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is tried).
For the muxer, only the B<tcp> and B<udp> options are supported.


=item B<rtsp_flags>

Set RTSP flags.

The following values are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<filter_src>

Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

=item B<prefer_tcp>

Try TCP for RTP transport first, if TCP is available as RTSP RTP transport.

=back


Default value is B<none>.


=item B<allowed_media_types>

Set media types to accept from the server.

The following flags are accepted:

=over 4


=item B<video>


=item B<audio>


=item B<data>


=back


By default it accepts all media types.


=item B<min_port>

Set minimum local UDP port. Default value is 5000.


=item B<max_port>

Set maximum local UDP port. Default value is 65000.


=item B<timeout>

Set maximum timeout (in seconds) to wait for incoming connections.

A value of -1 means infinite (default). This option implies the
B<rtsp_flags> set to B<listen>.


=item B<reorder_queue_size>

Set number of packets to buffer for handling of reordered packets.


=item B<stimeout>

Set socket TCP I/O timeout in microseconds.


=item B<user-agent>

Override User-Agent header. If not specified, it defaults to the
libavformat identifier string.

=back


When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received packets
(since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost totally). This
can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to zero (via
the C<max_delay> field of AVFormatContext).

When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with B<ffplay>, the
streams to display can be chosen with C<-vst> I<n> and
C<-ast> I<n> for video and audio respectively, and can be switched
on the fly by pressing C<v> and C<a>.


=head3 Examples


The following examples all make use of the B<ffplay> and
B<ffmpeg> tools.


=over 4


=item *

Watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:
	
	ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4



=item *

Watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:
	
	ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4

=item *

Receive a stream in realtime:
	
	ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp <output>

=head2 sap


Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.
It is used for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the
streams regularly on a separate port.


=head3 Muxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:
	
	sap://<destination>[:<port>][?<options>]


The RTP packets are sent to I<destination> on port I<port>,
or to port 5004 if no port is specified.
I<options> is a C<&>-separated list. The following options
are supported:


=over 4



=item B<announce_addr=>I<address>

Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.
If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used SAP
announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
ff0e::2:7ffe if I<destination> is an IPv6 address.


=item B<announce_port=>I<port>

Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to
9875 if not specified.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets,
defaults to 255.


=item B<same_port=>I<0|1>

If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the
default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each stream on a
port 2 numbers higher than the previous.
VLC/Live555 requires this to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.
The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving requires all streams to be sent
on unique ports.

=back


Example command lines follow.

To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1


Similarly, for watching in B<ffplay>:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255


And for watching in B<ffplay>, over IPv6:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]



=head3 Demuxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:
	
	sap://[<address>][:<port>]


I<address> is the multicast address to listen for announcements on,
if omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. I<port>
is the port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular stream.

Example command lines follow.

To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://


To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]



=head2 sctp


Stream Control Transmission Protocol.

The accepted URL syntax is:
	
	sctp://<host>:<port>[?<options>]

=back



=item B<srtp_in_params>


=item B<srtp_out_params>

Set input and output encoding parameters, which are expressed by a
base64-encoded representation of a binary block. The first 16 bytes of
this binary block are used as master key, the following 14 bytes are
used as master salt.

=back



=head2 subfile

The underlying stream must be seekable.

Accepted options:

=over 4


=item B<start>

Start offset of the extracted segment, in bytes.

=item B<end>

End offset of the extracted segment, in bytes.

=back


Examples:

=head2 tee


Writes the output to multiple protocols. The individual outputs are separated
by |

	
	tee:file://path/to/local/this.avi|file://path/to/local/that.avi



=head2 tcp


Transmission Control Protocol.

The required syntax for a TCP url is:
	
	tcp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<listen=>I<1|0>

Listen for an incoming connection. Default value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<listen_timeout=>I<milliseconds>

Set listen timeout, expressed in milliseconds.


=item B<recv_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

Set receive buffer size, expressed bytes.


=item B<send_buffer_size=>I<bytes>

=back


The following example shows how to setup a listening TCP connection
with B<ffmpeg>, which is then accessed with B<ffplay>:
	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tcp://<hostname>:<port>?listen
	ffplay tcp://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 tls


Transport Layer Security (TLS) / Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:
	
	tls://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


The following parameters can be set via command line options
(or in code via C<AVOption>s):


=over 4



=item B<ca_file, cafile=>I<filename>

A file containing certificate authority (CA) root certificates to treat
as trusted. If the linked TLS library contains a default this might not
need to be specified for verification to work, but not all libraries and
setups have defaults built in.
The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.


=item B<tls_verify=>I<1|0>

If enabled, try to verify the peer that we are communicating with.
Note, if using OpenSSL, this currently only makes sure that the
peer certificate is signed by one of the root certificates in the CA
database, but it does not validate that the certificate actually
matches the host name we are trying to connect to. (With GnuTLS,
the host name is validated as well.)

This is disabled by default since it requires a CA database to be
provided by the caller in many cases.


=item B<cert_file, cert=>I<filename>

A file containing a certificate to use in the handshake with the peer.
(When operating as server, in listen mode, this is more often required
by the peer, while client certificates only are mandated in certain
setups.)


=item B<key_file, key=>I<filename>

A file containing the private key for the certificate.


=item B<listen=>I<1|0>

If enabled, listen for connections on the provided port, and assume
the server role in the handshake instead of the client role.


=back


Example command lines:

To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tls://<hostname>:<port>?listen&cert=<server.crt>&key=<server.key>


To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using B<ffplay>:

	
	ffplay tls://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 udp


User Datagram Protocol.

The required syntax for an UDP URL is:
	
	udp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form I<key>=I<val>.

In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows one to reduce loss of data due to
UDP socket buffer overruns. The I<fifo_size> and
I<overrun_nonfatal> options are related to this buffer.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4


=item B<buffer_size=>I<size>

Set the UDP maximum socket buffer size in bytes. This is used to set either
the receive or send buffer size, depending on what the socket is used for.
Default is 64KB.  See also I<fifo_size>.


=item B<bitrate=>I<bitrate>

If set to nonzero, the output will have the specified constant bitrate if the
input has enough packets to sustain it.


=item B<burst_bits=>I<bits>

When using I<bitrate> this specifies the maximum number of bits in
packet bursts.


=item B<localport=>I<port>

Override the local UDP port to bind with.


=item B<localaddr=>I<addr>

Choose the local IP address. This is useful e.g. if sending multicast
and the host has multiple interfaces, where the user can choose
which interface to send on by specifying the IP address of that interface.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<size>

Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.


=item B<reuse=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Set the time to live value (for multicast only).


=item B<connect=>I<1|0>

Initialize the UDP socket with C<connect()>. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
unreachable" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.


=item B<sources=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Only receive packets sent to the multicast group from one of the
specified sender IP addresses.


=item B<block=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Ignore packets sent to the multicast group from the specified
sender IP addresses.


=item B<fifo_size=>I<units>

Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.


=item B<overrun_nonfatal=>I<1|0>

Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

Set raise error timeout, expressed in microseconds.

This option is only relevant in read mode: if no data arrived in more
than this time interval, raise error.


=item B<broadcast=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow UDP broadcasting.

Note that broadcasting may not work properly on networks having
a broadcast storm protection.

=over 4


=item B<swr>

select the native SW Resampler; filter options precision and cheby are not
applicable in this case.

=item B<soxr>

select the SoX Resampler (where available); compensation, and filter options
filter_size, phase_shift, exact_rational, filter_type & kaiser_beta, are not
applicable in this case.

=back



=item B<filter_size>

For swr only, set resampling filter size, default value is 32.


=item B<phase_shift>

For swr only, set resampling phase shift, default value is 10, and must be in
the interval [0,30].


=item B<linear_interp>

Use linear interpolation when enabled (the default). Disable it if you want
to preserve speed instead of quality when exact_rational fails.


=item B<exact_rational>

For swr only, when enabled, try to use exact phase_count based on input and
output sample rate. However, if it is larger than C<1 E<lt>E<lt> phase_shift>,
the phase_count will be C<1 E<lt>E<lt> phase_shift> as fallback. Default is enabled.


=item B<cutoff>

Set cutoff frequency (swr: 6dB point; soxr: 0dB point) ratio; must be a float
value between 0 and 1.  Default value is 0.97 with swr, and 0.91 with soxr
(which, with a sample-rate of 44100, preserves the entire audio band to 20kHz).


=item B<precision>

For soxr only, the precision in bits to which the resampled signal will be
calculated.  The default value of 20 (which, with suitable dithering, is
appropriate for a destination bit-depth of 16) gives SoX's 'High Quality'; a
value of 28 gives SoX's 'Very High Quality'.


=item B<cheby>

For soxr only, selects passband rolloff none (Chebyshev) & higher-precision
approximation for 'irrational' ratios. Default value is 0.


=item B<async>

For swr only, simple 1 parameter audio sync to timestamps using stretching,
squeezing, filling and trimming. Setting this to 1 will enable filling and
trimming, larger values represent the maximum amount in samples that the data
may be stretched or squeezed for each second.
Default value is 0, thus no compensation is applied to make the samples match
the audio timestamps.


=item B<first_pts>

For swr only, assume the first pts should be this value. The time unit is 1 / sample rate.
This allows for padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no
assumption is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the beginning with
silence if an audio stream starts after the video stream or to trim any samples
with a negative pts due to encoder delay.


=item B<min_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger stretching/squeezing/filling or trimming of the
data to make it match the timestamps. The default is that
stretching/squeezing/filling and trimming is disabled
(B<min_comp> = C<FLT_MAX>).


=item B<min_hard_comp>

For swr only, set the minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in
seconds) to trigger adding/dropping samples to make it match the
timestamps.  This option effectively is a threshold to select between
hard (trim/fill) and soft (squeeze/stretch) compensation. Note that
all compensation is by default disabled through B<min_comp>.
The default is 0.1.


=item B<comp_duration>

For swr only, set duration (in seconds) over which data is stretched/squeezed
to make it match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value,
default value is 1.0.


=item B<max_soft_comp>

For swr only, set maximum factor by which data is stretched/squeezed to make it
match the timestamps. Must be a non-negative double float value, default value
is 0.


=item B<matrix_encoding>

Select matrixed stereo encoding.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<none>

select none

=item B<dolby>

select Dolby

=item B<dplii>

Default value is C<none>.


=item B<filter_type>

For swr only, select resampling filter type. This only affects resampling
operations.

It accepts the following values:

=over 4


=item B<cubic>

select cubic

=item B<blackman_nuttall>

select Blackman Nuttall windowed sinc

=item B<kaiser>

select Kaiser windowed sinc

=back



=item B<kaiser_beta>

For swr only, set Kaiser window beta value. Must be a double float value in the
interval [2,16], default value is 9.


=item B<output_sample_bits>

For swr only, set number of used output sample bits for dithering. Must be an integer in the
interval [0,64], default value is 0, which means it's not used.
